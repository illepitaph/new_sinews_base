            After winter gives the keys of daylight
            Hours over to Spring——Spring opens the screen door
            To ziplock Winter in cereal bowls——
            The bird circles the cathedral once, twice in the Spring
            The third time it pretends to be a cathedral
            Having two oculi——
            It thinks it can triumph light
            Clattered incandescently through the pillars
            The heart of the church is cold & blistery——
            Ready to be lightwood——splintered by time

      The bird opens its congregation of feathers
              The physicist opens the bible made of birdseeds
      She is a professor of time
      Outside she sees the trees in the priest voices
      Slants of light slaughter throats of the trees
            Trees fall slightly, holding on to their spines ///// gaze down at the floor of the earth
            At their shadow
            A dialogue of death startles the church
      The professor ambles outside from the aisle
      Her pleats swing like lawnmower blades
      Through the scattered bones of the trees
      Near the flowerbeds saturated with worried blue gems, bindweeds, scarlet
      Pimpernels, & Bermuda buttercups
      Flowers square their soft blades of affection——fearing for their lives

          Avifaunal memory gathers at the foreheads
          Of flowers, bird, & cathedral
          The blades of the dress move gracefully
          Through light
          Leaving the church to molest the body
          Spreading its legs open
          For the past to shovel into
          The hearts of the congregation are lifted higher and higher
          Light sways; darkness sways
          The Bermuda buttercups hang on tightly to their open blouses
          The scarlet pimpernels pull down their floating hearts
          Grappling for another portion of immortality
