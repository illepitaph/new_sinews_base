is plagued by dust.

A thing has its size and its shape beneath perspective variations. You tell me this, in the control
room. Out the window: light, the desert. South, behind the mountains, the city. Opposite, the
canyon. You point out the glass. You rotate the telescope on its base. On the table, a map. Out the
window, the field. You keep shelves of samples. You touch my hand, here. Hands receive an image
from the materials they handle, eyes from what they see. I record these. I see so far. Our hands
aren’t touching. This type of grass, that rhizome. Toward the city, wind. The desert climbs the
mountain, its dark face lightens at the bottom. Sand. The desert. You hold the telescope to my eye.
I see myself in the field, in the rows. On the map, the row, me crouched over the grass, parsing
grains with my fingers, dropping samples into a container, pulling my cart to the next coordinate.
You press my body so I move. Rotate the telescope. The conveyor along the quarry’s edge, trucks,
the sweepers clearing the road of sand. I brush sand from my arm. You brush sand from my arm.
