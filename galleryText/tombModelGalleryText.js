          Eleven people in attendance, including us, which seems pitifully disproportionate to the number
          of people who are in desperate need of advocacy, assistance, and support, though there was also
          the reminder: it was a logistical meeting which, though public, didn’t really have public applications,
          i.e. it wasn’t an information or storytelling session, and the information and stories that were shared
          were met with more logistics, like whether or not to discontinue potluck dinners or which phone plan to go
          with, etc. Isabel updated us on a migrant woman who was separated from her citizen children and was pushed
          by a border patrolman. She was pregnant and went into labor. Did she give birth in the detention center?
          She’d been deported before, but, as do many deportees, came up through again. Amanda told us about the 15
          year-old suffering from leukemia who’s soon going to be deported without the prospect of medical

                <p>Oh, the woman is a caseworker. She’s wearing her ID on a lanyard. There’s no rush getting
                into the car. The car is a boat. Now the man can exhale. He can look at the picture on the wall.
                It is new. He can give himself to the picture if he chooses—until he sees the very morbid waterfall,
                skeletal, cryptic, the opposite of life-giving, life taking away. What is she contemplating? If
                the waterfall is the woman’s conscience—The waterfall is the intimation of darkness such as exists
                obscuring the young girl’s face on the other wall. There is in each picture something white. The
                young girl is holding a bird. The waterfall is pallid. The moon. A triangular window. Is it true?
                The eyes. That’s where I am? A dormer or a window, looking out, worrying, though the source of my
                worry has already expired. My worry has taken on a life of its own. My worry is a monster. If I
                make monster, if I manifest monster, am I monster? </p>

                distance) is not a thing, even less ... Negative, a word: the negative of: something
                subtracted from, every <i>thing</i> has agency but negative space, which is naked, invisible.
                Positive space makes me anxious, so that light, i.e. fire, is of a depth even more dreadful
                than darkness, i.e. the park ... Negative space is a judgment, becomes a judgment.<br/><br/>
                Negative space is made. It takes an imposing army. No, the people wake up and walk outside

          knew were the greatest books—the books I most wanted, most needed, the most sacred books. But I knew something
          about the books: none of them were done. They were all incomplete. And yet, all of their authors were dead.
          This did not diminish my love and respect and desire for the books, but rather completed it.</p><br/><br/>

          against the shore, covering the shore, penetrating the town, covering the streets, yet shallowly, the flood
          was not too deep or treacherous; people could still walk, but their shoes soaked through. I had been to this
          town before. The waves had been even higher then and the town was underwater.</p>
