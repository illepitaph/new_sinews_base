          <GalleryProse>Attended Derechos Humanos meeting this evening in the library down 6th Avenue.
          Eleven people in attendance, including us, which seems pitifully disproportionate to the number
          of people who are in desperate need of advocacy, assistance, and support, though there was also
          the reminder: it was a logistical meeting which, though public, didn’t really have public applications,
          i.e. it wasn’t an information or storytelling session, and the information and stories that were shared
          were met with more logistics, like whether or not to discontinue potluck dinners or which phone plan to go
          with, etc. Isabel updated us on a migrant woman who was separated from her citizen children and was pushed
          by a border patrolman. She was pregnant and went into labor. Did she give birth in the detention center?
          She’d been deported before, but, as do many deportees, came up through again. Amanda told us about the 15
          year-old suffering from leukemia who’s soon going to be deported without the prospect of medical
          treatment in Mexico.<br/><br/>

                Oh, the woman is a caseworker. She’s wearing her ID on a lanyard. There’s no rush getting
                into the car. The car is a boat. Now the man can exhale. He can look at the picture on the wall.
                It is new. He can give himself to the picture if he chooses—until he sees the very morbid waterfall,
                skeletal, cryptic, the opposite of life-giving, life taking away. What is she contemplating? If
                the waterfall is the woman’s conscience—The waterfall is the intimation of darkness such as exists
                obscuring the young girl’s face on the other wall. There is in each picture something white. The
                young girl is holding a bird. The waterfall is pallid. The moon. A triangular window. Is it true?
                The eyes. That’s where I am? A dormer or a window, looking out, worrying, though the source of my
                worry has already expired. My worry has taken on a life of its own. My worry is a monster. If I
                make monster, if I manifest monster, am I monster?

                distance) is not a thing, even less ... Negative, a word: the negative of: something
                subtracted from, every <i>thing</i> has agency but negative space, which is naked, invisible.
                Positive space makes me anxious, so that light, i.e. fire, is of a depth even more dreadful
                than darkness, i.e. the park ... Negative space is a judgment, becomes a judgment.<br/><br/>
                Negative space is made. It takes an imposing army. No, the people wake up and walk outside
                and fear their own impulses, which become more and more foreign until they separate from
                their bodies and ... assume the form of an alternative people.

          about the books: none of them were done. They were all incomplete. And yet, all of their authors were dead.

          was not too deep or treacherous; people could still walk, but their shoes soaked through. I had been to this
          town before. The waves had been even higher then and the town was underwater.

      Pilgrim. Keiko gave The Poet an enormous apple. The Poet is skeptical at first, though he does not
      admit to skepticism, saying instead it’s not the kind of apple he normally likes. The Poet accepts
      the apple but does not eat it. He carries it around for days; bears knowledge without formalizing it.
      Days later, The Poet rediscovers the apple in his bag and eats it, all but the core. Keiko reconstitutes
      herself in The Poet’s mouth, though once the apple enters The Poet’s digestive system, Keiko is gone. The
      Poet, having indulged himself on the apple has indulged knowledge and evil, and with the apple still inside
      him, disappears. It was his acceptance. He accepted, he assented. The apple foretold. <br/><br/><br/>

        weaving. Dad’s story of the glowing ball in the woods he told to Jan and Greg, he told to Kelly and me: the woods
        became our woods, I pursued the glowing ball, I went into the woods in pursuit, the sun does not change
        positions, it stays fixed, implacable, encomium to rage, a photogram in the sky tangled by limbs, the story
        is one of day, and death, it takes leaping over a wall, the pursuit is one of faith and an inextinguishable
        need to know, to reach the sun, but also a need to understand distance, how nothing moves, how we are forever
        conscripted to our own perspectives, framed by our faces, which we never see: we worship distance, distance
        makes the story, all we know of history, that is, the world, in one way, we know by virtue of distance,
        which enforces correspondence: we drain as we eternalize the letters, we drain them and get drunk, I’m
        going to Los Angeles, it is now the next generation, what will remain of the previous generations, for us, for

          in an otherwise empty closet. There is a cop car parked, idly, at the stop sign on 17th Street,
          waiting to catch someone speeding up or down 4th Avenue. Neither gender, deviousness, dubiousness,
          but an automatic machine. There are a few flayed, spread feathers of white wing in the sky. The
          cop car’s fan is loud—the car is overheating. Cops stare for hours at small colorful squares,
          their kitchens are painted yellow, white curtains over the sink, but still they stand at a distance
          from their possessions—they’ve purchased a space for their distance, with what they’ve earned from
          staring at small colorful squares. It is hot sitting here on the stranger’s step, four days in a row.

        Walking back from the laundromat, reading Muriel Rukeyser’s <cite>The Life of Poetry</cite>, shadows of trees moving
        down the page: water washing over Muriel’s words—not being under water, but in a state of suspension,
        water becoming  the trees overhead. I am not moving, my mind is and by Muriel’s words, the desert
        profound with its ancient seas beating down its well-worn and precarious walls into rivers.

        A mourning dove is sitting on the top of a utility pole, at the top of the cross, and could
        be in the most remote part of the desert but for its coo and the apparent need for utility. Though
        there is no one around, and the mourning dove both approves of such absences and has no choice,
        is a bird, and somehow, underneath its sun-bleached clay-colored feathers, does not feel a single
        flush of grief. It does not take the highest seat in the neighborhood, though it might as well.<br/><br/><br/>
        We’re surrounded by flowers, which exist as human mute, but communicate with the means of painters.
        Lisa surprised me with a visit to the art museum library today, which I didn’t know existed.<br/><br/><br/>
        Lisa made photocopies of Buddhist art (Japanese), which she now has leaning against the wall
        she faces when she meditates.<br/><br/><br/>
        The library is exactly the focus of the moral imperative I was talking about: hidden from us, but
        known to some segment, however small. It needs to be recognized and sustained, recorded in its own
        blood development.

        While walking down the alleyway back to the apt. this morning, I heard a goat (maybe it was a sheep).
        All I could see was the darkness beyond an open door and I wondered who was sitting around and how they
        were holding themselves in relation to the animal ... <br/><br/><br/>
        All our conversations are efforts to understand: death, history, the transference of events and
        moments and experiences across history, what constitutes the self, presence, present, in exile, in
        exile from itself in the present, the rituals that give <span className={styles.grayShadow}>ORDER</span>,
        the symbolic orders and what they are made of.

        Lit candles for Sam. He goes into surgery tomorrow. One blue candle. One green candle. The red
        candle Lisa lit last night is still burning. The wax is liquid, the wick persists. Sam’s presence
        is in the acknowledgment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
        Morning. Sam’s surgery apparently without incident. He now holds within him a larger valve. He’s
        waking up. Our candles put a glaze on the memory, the future. The future is memory, projected. The
        sky is mostly white, herringbone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
