          <GalleryProse><p>Attended Derechos Humanos meeting this evening in the library down 6th Avenue.
          Eleven people in attendance, including us, which seems pitifully disproportionate to the number
          of people who are in desperate need of advocacy, assistance, and support, though there was also
          the reminder: it was a logistical meeting which, though public, didn’t really have public applications,
          i.e. it wasn’t an information or storytelling session, and the information and stories that were shared
          were met with more logistics, like whether or not to discontinue potluck dinners or which phone plan to go
          with, etc. Isabel updated us on a migrant woman who was separated from her citizen children and was pushed
          by a border patrolman. She was pregnant and went into labor. Did she give birth in the detention center?
          She’d been deported before, but, as do many deportees, came up through again. Amanda told us about the 15
          year-old suffering from leukemia who’s soon going to be deported without the prospect of medical
          treatment in Mexico.</p><br/>

          the content, but the book. I need to dream the content—then I’ll be writing it, more fully writing it.
          I fell asleep in a chair while reading a lecture on translation, which was turning translation over
          before getting to it: always warming up, as now, without being fully warm, I can see the inclusion
          of a quotation or a quotation of a passage equivalent to the length of a passage the author has
          written but not written by the author, and so on—anyway, I fell asleep, and when I woke all my
          fingers were in pain, stressed, at least, as if they’d all been bent back or pulled loose of
          their joints. I dreamed the book contained three central themes: RACE, DEATH & ART ... The dream
          was the incarnation of a prematurity, because the subject, or the theme or themes, is a consequence
          of the writing, not the instruction, so that the dream was also expressing an impatience with
          the writing, or more exactly, the lack of writing.</p>

          listening and talking: not the other person’s face, but what is behind them, on either side of them, on
