          Eleven people in attendance, including us, which seems pitifully disproportionate to the number
          of people who are in desperate need of advocacy, assistance, and support, though there was also
          the reminder: it was a logistical meeting which, though public, didn’t really have public applications,
          i.e. it wasn’t an information or storytelling session, and the information and stories that were shared
          were met with more logistics, like whether or not to discontinue potluck dinners or which phone plan to go
          with, etc. Isabel updated us on a migrant woman who was separated from her citizen children and was pushed
          by a border patrolman. She was pregnant and went into labor. Did she give birth in the detention center?
          She’d been deported before, but, as do many deportees, came up through again. Amanda told us about the 15
          year-old suffering from leukemia who’s soon going to be deported without the prospect of medical
          treatment in Mexico.</p><br/>

          their joints. I dreamed the book contained three central themes: RACE, DEATH & ART ... The dream
          was the incarnation of a prematurity, because the subject, or the theme or themes, is a consequence
