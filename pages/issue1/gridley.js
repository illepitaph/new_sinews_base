      As if the bird were not
      in one room, but many, and making the sound of many seabirds
      pinning dunes to blue and vibrant yards of wind. That sanding down
      was why,
      was surely what I felt the credo
      was, no mean or desperate motion, no graceless
      tangling in the rafters, but light as fire to an open flue,
      the relic beehive feathering up
      to ashes in the draft. This was where
      I told myself to live. And pressed my life to going over
      everything I did.

      The chair is a gesture. Of all
      the motions, there are two hands always
      pulling the chair out, or one hand saying, Sit down,
      it’s free. Now its wood shines with absence.
      Now it hardens to oak. Of all the wearing evenings
      and mornings, the chair, unlike
      a boat, is never named. Years pass and the chair goes by
      in duplicate, profligate, a map of lowered anchors
      printed so small they look like stars.

      by leaves. Cleaning the gutters, you’d had two
      wasp-stings in one day. The unaggressive
      paper-wasps had only just derived the delicate
      umbel of their hive. Acid for wasp venom,
      alkaline for bee. How deadly sweet it is,
      a datum, so way beside the point, but pointed
      nonetheless, desirable stings of quibbling,
      quarreling, jockeying for the smallest powers.
