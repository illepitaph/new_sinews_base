“You still keep that knife in the car.”
—the reality is
that I am awake
and listening to an
argument outside
half-listening
half-fighting alongside

but not all of the time

“We call those projects ‘The Jar’”
the private said to himself
while working on his birthday

We hid the beds behind the trash”

the one where your grandfather appears

instead I threw my whole life away

I turned my back on my people, Lord

left them for a trip up three flights of stairs

now the whole freak show is on the back of my hand

including capitalists looking up at the sky

Dear grandfather,

I met some bluesmen today.
Vanquished them all.
I declared, “your lady is with you,
but all these chairs in here
are mine.”
`}</pre>


<pre className={styles.standardLineation}>{`
Before I opened the door to the street
            I knocked
                        And the world let me in

Stumbled outside
And there were miles and miles
Of chalk outlines and window curtains
Littered across the earth’s city
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
Dear Bluesmen,

Now I am deader than you.
Please take your seats.

<pre className={styles.standardLineation}>{`
First, I must apologize to the souls of the house

              Wearing the cheek bones of the mask only
                         Pill bottle, my name is yours

Teeth of the mask now

Back of the head of the mask now

                         New phase of anti-anthropomorphism fending for real faces
                                    Pretending to be a drug addict by day and reading all night
                                                    While economists return to rumors of oxygen

Stuck with one of those cultures that believes I chose this family
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
I am not creative
Just the silliest of the revolutionaries

Conversing with the psychic middleman
Or
Wannabe mayor
About hating your enemies
A little more realistically
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.standardLineation}>{`
Our eyesight returning to red // Notepad swimming to red // Bracing for the medicine’s recoil

I need my left hand back
I broke my neck on the piano keys
Found paradise in a fistfight

Watching the universe’s last metronome
           Some have the nerve to call a “homeless teenager”
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
Just wait…
These religions will start resigning in a decade or two

Some colorfully
Some transactionally


In a cotton gothic society
`}</pre>
<p className={styles.leftJustified}>Class betrayal gone glassless // I mean ironically // my window started fogging over too</p>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
I remember childhood
Remember the word “Childhood” being a beginning
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.standardLineation}>{`
A poet loses his mind, you know, like the room has weather
Or first-girlfriend gravity
Poem gravity
Mind-game gravity
Or revolution languishing behind
The sugar in my good friend’s mind

The difference between me and you
Is that the madness
Wants me forever
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
Bright lights behind hyena eyes,
I mean, if I had to fall in love today
My grandchildren would be doomed
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.standardLineation}>{`
A pair of apartments
            Defining both my family
            And political composure

Books behind my back
Bail money paved into the streets

Playing:
Euphoria
Euphoria
Cliché
`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.rightJustified}>{`
Sharing a dirty deli sandwich with my friend
A cosmic tool counted on by scared people

Psychology of the mask now

Teeth of the mask again`}</pre>
