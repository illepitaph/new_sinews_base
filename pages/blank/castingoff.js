      More than could fit on a postcard, it was indelicate qualitatively, as I tried to express it over an American-sized glass of red
      wine that night at Amherst Coffee—the yield of my trip. It would be fair enough to call that trip a pilgrimage, which would be
      to put it differently. I put my discovery to you, David, as several discoveries, one of which I termed “futurity” just to add
      that, against appearances, I didn’t think the term appropriative there, not where my woman’s use of reproductive years to
      write, their perverse use, was the thing at issue. For me, anyway, and anyway regarding that particular discovery. I’d put to
      her, to Nathalie Quintane herself, that there was this one line in <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> that a critic of hers, building the feminist
      case, had latched on to with a strong grip throughout the resulting article. Where you say you’re minoritarian, or that
      your position is minoritarian, because you’re a woman, and so this critic latches on to that disclosure, that
      admission, but if you look at the text you’re not actually saying you’re minoritarian because you’re a woman, you’re
      saying you’re minoritarian because you’re a woman with big feet.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I wanted to impress you, and we’d come from that reading. You and I can be honest, between us, about the demands readings
      can make on the affective capacities. The good cheer. The decision, inexhaustible in its rigor, of when to leave, the
      lingering … Personally I always stay too long, and I hadn’t eaten; none of us had eaten. I had arrived with friends, with
      Rabia. I’d persuaded Rabia to join us despite all she had to do that week—“Come on,” I’d said, “this is a special time in
      our lives, graduate school”—and then, it turned out, had urgently to stop for gas, but the gas stations in Amherst were
      closed, and so we had to go fifteen minutes out of our way; I kept apologizing. We arrived at Amherst Coffee eating
      from a big bag of almonds found in a pocket of my car. My mom gave me a big bag of almonds every time I saw her though
      many times I’d told her that my teeth, worn down from grinding them at night, weren’t strong enough for me to enjoy this
      kind of nut comfortably; I think she did this because she had been so worried when, at 18, I went through my vegan
      phase. Minoritarian because I was a woman with eroded teeth whose mother brought her, always, bags of almonds …
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had been dozing, waking occasionally to a disturbing feeling of delinquency in duties, dozing on the bus in the hour
      before I was to meet Quintane. My friend Emma had made her observation gleefully the previous night, in Paris where I’d
      moved away from, leaving her, the previous year. You’re so busy this week that it’s great, there’s absolutely no opening
      for nostalgia to enter in, you’ll suffer from your trip back not at all … Unknown to Emma I had then stayed up very
      late, crouching at one edge of a mountainously tall air mattress that another friend, Zoey, had blown up for me; on
      the phone, I was trying to keep my voice down as Zoey and her boyfriend lay asleep, presumably, in the next room. I was
      negotiating with Malte, the German boyfriend I think I told you about, during the Malina reading group. During the
      pandemic, it was free to rebook. Rebooking could be done at the click of a button. Nothing could be easier. But if I was
      going to do that, a possibility that had originated as Malte’s idea, and move the classes I was teaching online, I wanted
      obviously to stay in Berlin, a city I had never visited, for more than a couple of days. He was getting cold feet. Just
      as I’d secured his agreement—I’d fly out of Berlin a week from then, we’d figure out what to do in between, he’d come
      to Paris, I’d go there, if we hated each other I’d go to a hotel—my phone, which I don't know if you’ve ever noticed
      is shitty and broken, died. I had been laughing, it was funny, he’d been funny, made proof of good humor in capitulating
      after a long resistance. Or it was nerves, my nerves. I don't know how I sounded. I got the phone working just to get
      the texts, in tenor somewhat frantic, walking his position back. He would meet me, we’d spend two days in Paris
      maximum. It was clear he’d inferred I’d hung up victoriously to change my booking before he could change his
      mind again. He thought me capable. I was interested to feel the spreading tingle of my mortification; it was 1 a.m. I
      may have felt resentful, also, that that card, of my extremity, had been played for me. There are times when it can really work.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had been sensitized previously to ways in which my, let’s say, positionality contributed in France, and possibly all
      over Europe, to the impression that I made. I think it was in pitching you this project, David, that I evoked universal
      human themes, displacement, leaving home, that would be dealt with in (even better) a comic register, because the case
      of these themes’ application, their instantiation, would be that of the American woman in Paris. In reading Lisa
      Robertson’s <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>The Baudelaire Fractal</span> I had my brainstorm about the radical potential of this category of
      identity (as if every identity category must have one). In this novel about a woman who wakes to the knowledge
      she has written all the works of Baudelaire, which brings to mind for her a youth spent as a girl in Paris, promiscuity
      is an expansive, dandyish style with benefits beyond the release from bourgeois domesticity, though it helps with
      that. Robertson is Canadian, I should say. But experimentation of this nature is also central to Carole
      Maso’s <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>The American Woman in the Chinese Hat</span> (as that title perhaps suggests, by the objectifying definite
      article) though the setting is the South of France, not Paris. Men can make for interesting writers, too, and
      Harry Mathews’s <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>My Life in CIA</span>, which late in my Paris life was recommended to me pointedly, tells
      the story of a caper of this friend of Perec’s in which Mathews decides to address by siding with some rumors
      flying about him, an American who has been hanging around Paris for so long that it’s suspicious. This is
      a canon of outstanding negativity, of seediness even. It restores to the American abroad, to certain
      Americans, some of the complexity, some of the negative power of which their situation has been
      stripped in the popular imagination—which is not to mention the imagination of Nathalie Quintane. Her
      novel <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Cavale</span> opens on the narrator’s fantasy of serving a perfectly cooked fish as a fine British
      lady, a fantasy abandoned on Page Two (at the top of the page) in favor of that of being american
      girl (“proud and sporting, between thighs in the shape of an S”). That pair of English words is used, the
      article left off, the lowercase Quintane’s.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It would have been unsporting, I may have felt, let’s say I felt, to put to bed that life without the full
      achievement of a plumbing of its depths, and in my own way, two years ago … Moving away from Paris can be
      mistaken, in certain cases, for a failure of imagination. In French, a Master’s thesis is an example of
      a <i>mémoire de fin d’études</i>—<i>mémoire</i> like “memory,” that cognate (except that the other gender is
      used for the thesis), which has always made me think of the game Concentration, a recitation or
      regurgitation “of the end of studies.” What I ended up with was something more
      like a <i>mémoire de fin de vie en France</i>, a phrase that in its clumsiness bears the imprint of my
      foreignness, my foreigner’s humor, and yet here I am, at my desk in the United States, working on my
      project just a little longer. But its black-hole aspect wasn’t the only way in which this project
      came to resemble an extension of projects like those of Robertson, Maso, Mathews in its exploration of
      some negative potential; this wasn’t even up to me, the exploration. It was chosen barely. There was
      that aggressive number of footnotes that I wrote, obviously.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But even this was only natural, the amplification of an oppositionality already latent in the gesture of
      translation—what the scholar of literature, writer, and of course translator Tiphaine Samoyault calls
      translation’s “violence”; her book <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Traduction et violence</span>, which came out as I was drafting, became
      important to me (and notice, David, the shared root with “traduce,” visible in the French version of
      the word). It reassesses, argues for the reassessment of, and even advocates for this violence, a reality
      that writing must be de-written before rewriting it can be achieved. This reality is well documented. Artaud,
      quoted I forget where, puts apt words to the feeling of fiery, transgressive glee (something Artaud was
      good at feeling; I don’t know if you’ve ever seen, David, video of him acting), “a malicious flame” that
      “leapt up in” him, on translating out of English, claiming the words as his own (and that
      impersonation, translation, is, like all the others, mine). But Samoyault situates this aggression, as well
      as the need for its recall, in a highly contemporary and actually quite dire context. At stake in the rise
      of machine translation is the technologically mediated disappearance of disfavored languages. Samoyault is
      clear on what she’s up against—steamrolling, ethnocentric—in wresting an imaginary out of the hands of
      state and European governmental actors all too happy to hold up, to brandish translation, to praise it, as
      a strategy of pacification, of reducing difference to something decorative, something in need of
      fixing (and, in the day of Google Translate, something fixed easily), when difference is right
      to be political. It “breaks the reproduction of roles” (she quotes Barthes) in opening
      relationships to renegotiation, renewal. Samoyault is anti-defanging.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What I am getting at, or what I would like now to claim to be getting at, is that out of the findings
      of Project Quintane, one of the most important, not the most interesting but the
      most, perhaps, destructive, the discovery that risks invalidating every other, a real oppressor
      of a discovery that has to be risen up against, is that the arrangement of the life of this great
      author—a working-class author who, since passing the state’s exam, works as a schoolteacher less
      than part time, and can count on that state’s pension, on healthcare—just isn’t possible in the
      US. Not in our century, not now.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I don’t know if I’d come out and say it like that if Quintane weren’t the first to, immediately, attribute her
      capacity for literary industry to this situation. She was quick to do so. This attribution, characteristically
      humble, as if the outpouring of her production were a matter of situational luck, would be made as
      soon as she had me in her car; the nine-hour workweek, or whatever, was her secret, she would say, warning a young
      seeker against the lure of getting rich. A golden light was settling on the foothills of the Alps, brown mountains
      all around. This shift in Quintane’s life, the settling down to work that she managed, may have coincided with
      the lightening of her duties as a functionary but, I knew from my study, it began with her arrival in
      Digne-les-Bains, a city of sixteen thousand in southeastern France where Quintane moved when she was just about my age.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The pivotal age of early maturity, it was well adapted, I apparently thought, to a sounding of the “creepy
      side of translation,” as Zoey had said the night before, getting it right away.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Off I went.

      I shouldn’t have been dozing because I had to think, prepare. And I had been cramming. For days I had been
      cramming; I had stayed up, my first night in Paris, reading <span className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span>, the most recent of some three books
       by Nathalie Quintane to have been published since I’d left the country a little over a year before. From time
      to time I’d pause in my reading to make a note in the back of that book of a line, a phrase, something that
      occurred to me as worthy of inclusion in the email correspondence that I’d entered into with Quintane, fishing
      for this invitation. <i>Chère Nathalie, c’est depuis Paris cette fois que je vous écris</i> … My mind kept drifting there.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span>—ostensibly about an incident in the 1970s in which a Digne schoolteacher, Nelly Cavallero, was
      fired for indecency (long story; she would leave her house unlocked), really a pretext for Quintane’s oral
      history tracing back a lineage of revolutionary thinking—was, I couldn’t help noticing, very sweet in tone. Too
      sweet, maybe. The narrator had some aversion to writing the story, and while this aversion was referred to
      often, I didn't get it viscerally. Cavallero’s firing wasn’t investigated in its details, and the book seemed in
      other ways to lack the vigor I associate with independence of investigation. Subjects step in, admittedly
      charmingly, to qualify accounts they’ve given, at times correcting this investigator’s understanding: “It’s
      a shame … two or three years out I still remembered everything … now it’s distant.” There are some lovely
      descriptions of landscapes. Even the back-cover notice (which, for Quintane’s publisher P. O. L, authors
      are in charge of composing) was lengthy, sincere; these notices are a specialty of Quintane’s, who
      more typically uses them to carry off a salty, even hostile salvo, normally an acid joke, in four or
      fewer sentences. My reading deepened until, at last, I wrote in a margin my note, a kind of outburst, registering
      my sense of betrayal in response to the assertion, from this major poet of an art engaged with life, of a uniquely
      combative political art as Quintane’s has been characterized, that, “Writer or teacher, it was so I could be
      left alone.” Left the hell alone might be apter, as the idiom is somewhat impolite (<i>foutre la paix</i>). “She feels
      less free on the page in this one,” I said helplessly to the bookseller at the MK2 on the Bassin de La Villette, and
      I stumbled out to see a line of streetlamps that to me always resembles, reflected in that wide segment of
      the blue-green canal, a string of pearls.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Here I should confess I’ve been trying for ten years to fit that simile into some piece or other of my writing about
      Paris, and it has never worked. The streetlamps always seemed, as pearls, especially resistant to being pinned down
      on the page, and yet they seemed to want that, also. There is a jealousy that art has for life, something I’d always
      read into Quintane’s writing, which is generous in positing many options for the relationship between life and
      art, for a working relationship between these. For a page or so of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span>, they are described as matching up
      exactly. It’s 1976, and Nelly has linked up with a traveling band of theater artists on the road from Avignon to
      Strasbourg. They’re radicals, every rule up for debate, down to the interdiction on smoking cigarettes for members of
      the audience. Occasionally a play would call for an actor to light up, and there seemed no good reason to apply
      the rule unfairly. “The troupe is a community. The theater is communal life. No difference,” Quintane writes
      in conclusion, “between art and life.” It was time, anyway, similarly, relatedly, for me to leave my books
      behind, or rather to make the selection of which ones to bring in a dedicated tote bag, and for my own project
      to get up onto its feet—for some fourth wall to be broken.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I would have described the voyage to you, David, as I did to other Americans. From Paris, I had to take the high-speed
      train to Aix-en-Provence, a journey south of nearly three hours, and catch a bus headed back up north to stay on it
      for nearly as long. Through light-blue curtains of a hospital-type synthetic I saw that landscape, Mediterranean with
      low, sparse trees, give way. Off to the right we’d passed the factory for L’Occitane en Provence. There was a green
      field full of tiny white flowers of which only those heads, as if floating, could be seen. Spray-painted onto
      the embankment of a river the road followed was the phrase <i>MACRON TRAITRE</i> as those mountains, as the Alps, came
      into view. As the bus made its stops I gave myself over to taking in the sounds of the cash register, to observing
      the smug and mild interest that I felt, something like pity, that onboard you feel for the people who come up to
      ask the driver questions about where the bus is headed, a problem you have solved. I noted down the pronunciations
      they made of the name that had become important to me: <i>Dee-ña</i>. <i>DEEN</i>. Quintane’s oeuvre is full of allusions to
      this place. And so it was a special feeling of dislocation to see that word printed not on a page but, for the first
      time, on a sign, and then on many signs, having seen it flash above the windshield of that bus to indicate a terminus.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I’d bought the notepad from another Nathalie, a kind of false Nathalie or a Nathalie differently rendered. At the chain
      stationer’s in the Aix-en-Provence station I’d overheard another worker, a man, call out to the cashier in passing as
      I was transacting with her and neglecting, obviously, to note down what he said, <i>How’s it going</i>, <i>Nathalie</i>, or, <i>Catch
      you later</i>, <i>Nathalie</i>, or, <i>Keep up the good work</i> … Evidently I’d been nervous, in front of the wrong Nathalie. I’d asked
      a lot of questions, for example about the phone charger I was buying to be sure it was the right one, and had stopped
      back in to buy, just in case, a second notepad identical to the first (the only kind they had). Of course I was
      nervous. If I look back at my notes from the days before the trip, they are more consistent, however, with a kind of
      mesmerized appreciation, wonder: <i>5:15 PM</i>—<i>this person whose books I’ve spent 50€ on this weekend has just warned me
      via email that she has 2 cats + hopes I’m not allergic</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And there she was, the poet. With a sweeter appearance than I had imagined, perhaps. I thought of the French
      adjective <i>doux</i>, which is more like “gentle,” in between “sweet” and “gentle.” Slimmer, her hair redder. I
      guessed she’d dyed it. I was wearing my best sweater, which I’d known was a mistake, too fussy and loud, over-the-top, and, in
      the full blush of this knowledge, I had pulled it on, unwilling to wear anything other than my best for the occasion, that
      of meeting Nathalie Quintane. I had also foregone makeup in some hope of appearing serious. But Quintane was wearing
      makeup. Spread over her face was a powder that would give it, in the southerly light of that city where she’d settled, a
      passing shimmer.

      <br/>
      The line in question, from 2010’s <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span>, a meandering, anecdote-rich treatise—and I’m afraid I’ll have to reproduce
      the whole sentence, a very long one, as well as the sentence that comes before it; sorry David—is: “Being forty-five, or
      fifty-five or sixty-five isn’t any reason for us not to want, any longer, intense lives, or to lose the desire to write
      intense texts. Or to read them; I bought, especially in 2008-2009, a considerable number of historical political
      books, attempting perhaps to make up for my numerical minority in gorging it on these books, literature’s books having
      failed to suffice, the fleeting fad for <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Princesse de Clèves</span> having changed nothing of the spectral, dwindling, disappearing
      nature of all novels and of literary efficaciousness in general, minoritarian on all fronts, minoritarian because I read
      books, minoritarian because they’re literature, minoritarian because, reading books and writing them, I remain the child
      of salarymen, born themselves of workers, minoritarian because, granting that I’ve reached the height of 1.8 meters, I
      am a woman, and because I have big feet, minoritarian because I live in the countryside, and because the countryside is
      a strange thing, as Benjamin of Tarnac suggested so strongly in describing cops of the forensics team bounding joyfully
      over the fields and visiting the chicken coop and saying the countryside wasn’t so bad as all that and deciding maybe, on
      their return, to plant tomatoes.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There are a half-dozen things to unpack here before I can move on, but by the time they’re out there you’ll have a solid
      understanding, David, of some of Quintane’s major themes, saving you the trouble maybe of poking through the sections I
      present in French with your Duolingo and your dictionary. Even in the original (a cognate that can’t, in French, be used
      in that way as a noun but is only an adjective, a reminder so ingrained in me by now as to issue automatically) the passage
      is dense enough to warrant a footnote of its own, and what Quintane chooses, out of all that, to gloss is the reference
      to <i>La Princesse de Clèves</i>, a seventeenth-century novel that had become by 2010 oddly popular in France. The odd way in
      which it became popular—getting into Quintane’s notion of literary efficaciousness—was Sarkozy’s singling it out, twice, to
      name it, with vitriol that would have to be considered excessive, as a horror of irrelevance to civil servants whose exams
      contained the reference. Subsequently it was celebrated by many. Striking students put on readings.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Utility such as they found in <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Clèves</span> is not, for Quintane, extra-literary, as
      I hazard in the more theoretical French part of all this. I give examples such as that of a page of verse in <i>Chaussure</i> that, while
      unlabeled, resembles a drinking song for workers clearly. You could tear it out, I thought, in which it reminded me of kits for
      making paper dolls. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Un œil en moins</span>, about participating in activism at the time of Nuit Debout, is a fat, diaristic
      book demanding, like the strike, a period of abstention from paid labor. It bears other formal resemblances to activism, but
      this thickness, unusual for Quintane, is also the object of her pun on the back cover; she calls it a <i>pavé</i>, colloquial
      for “tome” as well as, literally, “paving stone” like those that have been torn up and used as barricades in urban uprisings such
      as those of the Commune and May 1968. Or thrown—“Less One Eye” is a fair translation of that title; a cat of Quintane’s, in the
      course of the year being chronicled, loses an eye to infection. If you are on her level it’s not merely the personal that’s
      political but the personal life of your cat; something interesting about my thesis <i>de fin de vie en France</i>, or a glaring
      omission, is that, despite the plethora of examples given for a use-value of literature, its own highly political purpose, “to
      get me a visa” as I used to say, is not discussed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My reading of these aspects of Quintane’s works hinges on a line from <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Un œil en moins</span>, a provocation, about a portion of the
      Invisible Committee’s readers making “practical use” rather than “literary use” of the books. Speaking of things being
      thrown, of the projectiles of insurrectionists, <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> is the book of Quintane’s
      with that committee at its center, which brings me back to my project of glossing, to “Benjamin de Tarnac.” Tarnac, a village
      of about three hundred in the middle of that country, on the wonderfully named Plateau de Millevaches, names that location
      but also—I’ll treat you like the dictionary the translator makes recourse to—a scandal. In the <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Affaire Tarnac</span>, young people living on a commune there—the “Tarnac Nine”—were
      arrested on charges of terrorism, accused of sabotaging the railway by placing a hook of reinforcing steel on its
      lines. Julien Coupat, their supposed leader, was a literary man, having famously attended the EHESS (where my own
      thesis, the present work, was undertaken) and founded the journal <i>Tiqqun</i>. He was also suspected of having
      participated in this Invisible Committee, an anonymous collective whose <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>L’insurrection qui vient</span> (2007, published by Semiotexte in 2009 as <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>The Coming Insurrection</span>) was entered in as evidence wholesale. Literature
      itself was on trial, as Quintane writes in <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Oeil</span>. In <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span>, which is centered on this episode, she manages an analysis of the
      aesthetic, the affective implications of all this, not only the terror of realpolitik, but another, subtler
      uncanny—the freshly bared and glinting contiguity of life and literary art. Coupat, interviewed for <i>Le Monde</i> from
      prison in May 2009, was discovered reading Foucault (<span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Surveillance and Punishment</span>—<i>bien sûr</i>). In <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span>, Quintane has herself, her speaker, claiming to be the Invisible Committee—echoing
      petitions of that time with many signatures.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> is paradoxical, however, in this ostensible focus on <i>events</i>. It is more
      properly a book of continuity, taking continuity as its subject. Looking around, for example at a literature festival
      on the island of Majorca, the narrator finds she is observing, in a police line for example, a tightening of the apparatus
      of the security state. Out of her “flash” of fascism a bigger picture is, in the book’s course, developed. It turns out to
      be, in the course of her reframing, of the reframing she performs, a denial of the feasibility of revolution in Quintane’s
      day so widespread, so potent it amounts to mass hysteria. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>The Coming Insurrection</span> followed
      on from, was inspired by, the 2005 riots in French suburbs, uprisings Quintane considers the chattering classes have been
      hasty in discounting. I remember where we were standing as she told me <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> was
      about the problem of transmission of knowledge; I raced to make a note of this. Quintane’s own generation and Marine Le
      Pen’s has been, as she puts forth in both <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> and <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Stand up</span>, the missing link, since 1968. But this is no excuse for inaction, poor timing
      isn’t; “intense” is a lowkey reference (<i>tumulte</i>, in <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Stand up</span>, being more
      obvious) to Georges Bataille’s morbidly serious claim of having lived through a surpassingly tumultuous epoch. She pokes fun
      at him and, for the moment being, was showing me the school where she taught. I think that we had had to cross a bridge. The
      light was getting low and orange. In a traffic circle the monument was decorated for Armistice Day, decked out in patriotic
      bunting. Because I can remember vaguely in this way as well as tracking where I was in town as each note was taken down, this
      notepad has a psycho-geographic function. Sprinkled in among my notes, as if to avoid drawing notice, are the <i>ad hominem</i> observations
      I couldn’t resist surreptitiously making—“long delicate fingers,” “extremely slow walk”—tucked between the lines of pages
      peppered all across with the abbreviation of my own devising, “Q.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We had come, in that place, to a standstill. I had tripped her up, eager as I was to demonstrate that I had done the reading. In
      the changing light I thought, below the delicately layered makeup that had caught it, she was, actually, blushing. Out of
      consternation; we’d stopped moving. Quintane, leading us, had stopped short on that sidewalk in accommodating, suddenly, heated
      discussion I’d begun about some connection between <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> and <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span>, a tonal similarity. Both deal with history, each a work of history or
      almost; they use footnotes. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> self-identifies as a “mute book”—prosy,
      cultivated, not disruptive in its language. “So I write a mute book; I take that risk. I can’t write my revolt in any other
      prose if I wish to be heard.” Elegiac, even. I may have said that; it’s a perfect cognate, <i>élégiaque</i>, but different
      enough from the French éloge that I can never get it. Tomates had been a turning point in her reception by the
      public. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span> was darker, I offered, more troubling, because the
      problem of transmission both books consider becomes, in that book, shaky epistemologically; it might not be possible. The <i>soixante-huitards</i> being
      interviewed are dying off; there’s a lot they have forgotten. Saying this, I was, however, thinking
      something different, that it was a strangely satisfying feeling, new and negative, to see a favorite author frozen to the
      spot because of something I was doing (her reader, who had spent so many hours transfixed). That was a cheap thrill, and, like
      approval can be, I may have found it cheapening. In my French conclusion, I make much of an idea about a reste, a remainder
      of the translator’s operation, that for Derrida is the untranslatable; here was another. Does it matter if the author
      agrees with your reading? What difference can that make?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      All over town, the revenge of the real continued. Digne was, even now (from the briefest of glances at my camera roll), blue
      skies. Fluffy clouds. By each chestnut tree were piled golden leaves, still dry and fresh. I had proposed to Quintane from
      the comfort of my home, United States, this <i>voyage sur les traces de MLP</i>. But the Greek restaurant was, it ensued, way
      over there. The angle of ten degrees was nowhere to be seen. My thesis that I’d printed off was flopping in my hands as I
      made reference to the text. Distinctly I remember the exercise of restraint, refraining, or so I thought, from taking notes
      so frequently I’d seem insane. Quintane caught on anyway and, in a hostly way, pointed out a bench, asking if I might
      want, before we moved on, to note “two-three” things. And before long we were seated, my notepad between us. I’d gotten
      coffee while Quintane ordered warm milk, like a cat. I reached for my copy of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Les années 10</span>, which wasn’t there. It was in, of course, her car. Did I want her to
      get it? This offer of Nathalie Quintane’s was more grounds for panicking, directions have always been my worst subject, and
      it was adrenaline, I think, that let me find my way back to her car where it was parked—where Nathalie Quintane had parked
      it. There it was. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Les années 10</span>, the object, is a brightly colored book. Orange, it
      is deeply dyed. Mine is well loved, and use has turned the edges of the spine white, rubbing off the color.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You were the one who said, at Amherst Coffee, said I’d have to capture in my writing what I told you there about the big
      car of Nathalie Quintane being one of the dirtiest I’d ever been in. No way, I said in answer. Which is how I end up in
      such positions of regret for all the questions that I never manage asking. Simple questions, like: Why is your car so
      big? Is it for hauling stuff, what stuff? Why is it so dirty, what is your relationship to cleaning out your car? What is
      the proper relationship of the writer to cleaning out a car?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And relatedly: is anything sacred? There was, back at that café, an unease, a flickering disappointment I felt only
      intermittently but accessed, felt at the alacrity with which other questions, about which parts of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Stand up</span> were true—questions I’d puzzled over, left to conjecture; puzzling that
      had seemed to open doors on hidden meanings—were cleared up by the author. The Barrière family, Jewish, had existed, for
      example; she wouldn’t have made that up. Regarding <span className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span> also, she was open
      in discussing deontology, and even as certain lines of my questioning began to seem small, mere, wasted, huge and messy
      ones were being opened up. There were questions that Nathalie Quintane found herself wanting to ask of those who came
      places to do fieldwork—questions like what right they had. To ask their questions, air publicly the details of people’s
      lives. Anyway, because she lived among them, all their lives made in the one place, Digne, she would not have offended
      her interviewees. This was a question that seemed to her “moral.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Difficult territory, for me in that setting anyway, which makes me remember the last thing I meant to gloss from
      that <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> quotation—“minoritarian” (which I’ve translated aslant; “minority”
      is, except for the connotation in American English about race, here inappropriate, a cognate). For a long time a highlight
      of Quintane’s author bio on the P. O. L website has been the showstopping sentence <i>Je suis peu nombreuse</i>, <i>mais je
      suis décidée</i>. Placing the author in a society of one as part of a “biography [that] reduces itself to a few malicious
      lines,” as the critic Anne Malaprade has termed another of Quintane’s of comparable length, this is as if designed to
      scare off those who would search the life for clues to the art, as cops search—you’ll remember that <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span>, her breakthrough, is about the juridical usage of literature and, perhaps, identity
      to persecute supposed authors—and even so, with my notepad, I’d shown up.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      She had a schoolteacher’s sense for which directions to give, the necessary ones. So this had been, evidently, because I
      kept forgetting, in my negligence disregarding the rule she had set to close the door to the room where I was sleeping, and
      would find myself in consequence discreetly giving chase to the cats of Nathalie Quintane (how well she knew them), chasing
      cats to capture and remove them, activity the poet politely ignored. The room was taken up by a grand piano at the center. I
      chased those cats around the grand piano. There were plants, one a spindly plant, atop that grand piano. The handle of the
      door was offset slightly, I don’t know how to name what made it wrong. It had been set askew somehow. Repeatedly I had trouble
      getting it open, an instant of trouble. But it was figurative, my term when, failing to sleep, I wrote in my notes about
      feeling “trapped.” Quintane had given me plenty to worry about, but what I really feared by now was that the whole enterprise
      of a text I’d promised, David, you, would be weighted down, go flat. With me constrained, doomed from then to write another
      mute text, not only elegiac but, worse, loyal to the record. The burden of the real, history’s burden, would prove a lethal
      weight. You and I had a plan, laid in Massachusetts, for me to write something funny; it would be totally wrecked. And
      maybe there had been always but unacknowledged a sinking melancholy to the project, drowning it in this tsunami of
      nostalgia, attempt, pathetic, to make something of my life in France, get something useful out … <i>Les bons profs savent
      jouer de ça</i> : Quintane’s line was running through my head as I tried sleeping; it’s from <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Ultra-Proust</span>. And connecting to Nathalie Quintane’s WiFi network, I saw, then, a
      message from Malte, afraid that he had COVID.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>*</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So what did I hope to get out of life that I hadn’t gotten out of art? This time, I mean. In the French you may still be
      struggling, David, to read, some demonstration is made of my understanding of the theory of Gérard Genette, whose contributions
      include a taxonomy of possible relationships between texts (e.g., intertextuality, paratextuality, architextuality, metatextuality,
      hypotextuality, hypertextuality); analogously I offer, as part of my conclusion, a breakdown of the operations on display in
      my own footnotes. Meanwhile in that French introduction, I say something about the stakes of an assertion of the scholar Alice
      Kaplan’s being unclear; the stakes of learning French as a foreign language having given her, as a young person, “a place to
      hide,” remain, in the telling of her memoir, unclear. As I suggest. But if I were to follow Kaplan, there are any number of
      claims like that that it would be possible to advance about this project and its relationship to yours truly, David, I mean
      me. About my writing in French being, for example, a translation of the self. About my journey to Digne being a translation
      of art into life. These raise, again, questions without answers; that French section begins on a helpful quote from George
      Steiner about there being, of translation, no theory properly speaking, only narratives of praxis. So this time—you
      know, starting off—I really did try, out of the gate, to help you out, David, by translating into English all I’d written
      in the French, but what I came to find was lacking, for me personally, was that sense of transgression—of fun—that enlivens
      translation, making something exciting out of an eye-crossing task. Where you get to put your mouth around the words of
      someone else, speak them as yours.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have exaggerated, maybe. It was no disaster I was dozing, for I had at hand, I could refer to, a hard-copy version of
      myself that I’d prepared in Aix, waiting for the bus. The questions I’d assembled completely covered, in their
      groupings—<i>Understanding/verification traduction fideleté</i>, <i>Interpretations de ce texte</i>, <i>Thèmes de l’œuvre
      quintanien</i>, <i>Questions plus larges</i>—four sheets of paper (the questions with their brackets, headers, arrows, page
      references). Torn from their pad, they had come away cleanly. I warned Quintane that my questions for her would spread over
      four progressive levels, and I’d followed her home by the time we’d reached the last out of the lists, <i>Questions plus
      larges</i>, with its prying, personal, salacious flavor. Quintane’s friend, a filmmaker, had offered us the use of some
      equipment. And this presented an improvement over the digital recorder I had brought. It sat with us still and fluffy
      like an extra cat.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Congruous with her slow walk was—as I may well find myself considering anew, replaying that recording—the schoolteacher’s
      way she had of talking. As her great height had educated her gait, so too in an analogous operation had her conversation
      taken on its character in years spent leading classes. Nothing much was dropped, or so it seemed to me. Our discussion
      unfolded in a synthesizing manner. It was easy, around Nathalie Quintane, to think. Impressionability is a part of life, and
      yet it wasn’t until my late twenties, or thereabouts, that I realized I was going to imitate others no matter what and
      so, rather than attempting to stem off that impulse, would do best by it in making a careful selection. But even when I
      did, some of these people I ultimately chose to glom on to turned out to be modeling examples of, primarily, selflessness,
      tolerance—as if referring the problem, sending it someplace beyond (<i>plus loin</i>). And there I was, in any case, availing
      myself of Quintane. Coaxing out of her some maxims I might use to broaden the horizon of my thought, make myself a little
      larger. Autobiography leaks into Quintane’s work in a way that makes of her life a resource, epitomized maybe by the use
      she makes, throughout her oeuvre, of Digne itself. A typically, even prototypically mid-sized French city, she finds it
      representative, investigates it accordingly. For a book of hers about another city in the South of France she’d taken
      photos out her window as she told me, giving this as an example of the use she makes of Digne—we were walking, then, its
      Boulevard Gassendi—using it, in that case, for her book <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Saint-Tropez</span> … She trailed off. But I knew, because I knew by
      heart her every title, that she was just being polite, and, perversely, I supplied it, the full title, self-identifying: <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Saint-Tropez –
      Une Américaine</span>, “an American woman.” (When on our arrival at her house a cat appeared, I blurted
      out “Chemoule,” a name known to me from <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Un œil en moins</span>.)
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There’s imitation, study, and then there’s “diabolical possession,” you know on the other hand, a phrase offered up by
      Quintane in responding to one of my lower-level questions about Stand up. As I was embarking on my project in its
      original, academic framework, I had found it challenging to get the attention of the critic who was serving as the
      director of this Master’s thesis, which was no surprise, she had in point of fact warned me, but a side effect was that
      what she, the eminent critic, said by way of advice took on, for its rarity, a glittering preciousness. She had said
      something, I could have sworn she’d said something, about attending to the moments of this text where an ambiguity, or
      overlap, was present between the voices of the narrator and MLP, or the narrator’s fantasy of MLP, and while I hadn’t so much
      noticed those moments at the outset, I began to see them everywhere. Glossing them, performing a detangling, ascribing words
      to one or the other of these characters or to both, became a motif of my French footnotes, David. And then, during the
      defense, the critic said with finality that the division between the voices was, on second thought, assez nette. I was
      left to wonder if all that activity, all that glossing, had been undertaken in my, as they say, right mind, or if I had
      been, well … But then with me Quintane, in characterizing her relationship to MLP in writing <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Stand up</span> as one of possession, of her being possessed, not only allowed this reading
      but went so far as to make reference to the film <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>The Exorcist</span>. (French people tend to think me knowledgeable about the films of
      Hollywood.) And because there would never be any way of furnishing an answer to the question of if my thesis director
      had possessed me diabolically, this confirmation of Quintane’s was especially satisfying. Je me laisse posséder, she
      had said—although, on reflection, because after all her agreement didn’t matter, I had and have no way of knowing if
      Quintane was just agreeing with my reading in the way a teacher does, to be supportive of my
      inquiry. <i>Et quand je dis je c’est le texte</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I can say more, with your patience, about what I mean by “life” and what I mean by “art”—a little vague, I know—which
      will probably bring me back to the woman thing, too, if I’m not careful. Out of my <i>Questions plus larges</i>, the one that
      I kept harping on has to do with another line of resonance from <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Ultra-Proust</span>. It deals with a conversion to literature that Marcel Proust is
      calculated to have undertaken. Such <i>conversion à la littérature</i> is defined, in <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Ultra-Proust</span>, in terms of lifestyle. The speaker here is thinking on their
      feet, ellipses theirs: <i>l’entrée dans une autre forme de vie</i>, <i>comme on dit aujourd’hui</i>, <i>c’est-à-dire
      une conversion</i>… <i>On ne peut écrire ce qu’il a écrit dans le temps qui lui était imparti</i>, <i>qu’il savait
      lui être imparti</i>, <i>sans conversion</i> … <i>une conversion à la littérature</i> … Impossible to have written what he
      did, in the time that he knew left to him, without conversion, conversion, “the entry into another form of life.” So, Nathalie
      Quintane, <i>des astuces</i>, any tips? <i>Que faire</i> ? In a preliminary way however I had suggested that there were at
      least two very fair objections to the line of questioning I’d be pursuing, first of course that <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span>, surveillance-state-y one, and second that it’d be, just, inappropriate, the
      personal, and yet again I didn’t think so but sometimes thought it central, even, to an understanding of the politics
      of literature, to approach the question of how to write by a question of how to organize one’s life. Which is maybe
      why a paper on the politics of literature will devolve into, find its level with, bottom out on, lifestyle
      journalism, as I am discovering—did you know that Nathalie Quintane enjoys a yogurt after meals? Quintane’s
      response to this, anyway, was gratifying, immediate; she said knowingly that Christophe Tarkos was the poet
      of that—even though I personally had actually considered Nathalie Quintane to be the poet of that, a strong
      candidate. In <span className={styles.grayShadow}>La Cavalière</span>, for example, she posits three options—the
      remaking of institutions, leaving cities to live on communes, doing both—saying she tends, herself, to favor
      Number One in the morning, Two by evening, Three at noon.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Yogurt, yogurt, yogurt—and later, it occurred to me inescapably without my knowing what it meant, occurred to me as
      important without my knowing why, that two of the poets we’d most spoken about—Tarkos, and Jack Spicer—were men who
      died at forty.<a href="#footnote"> [1] </a> All around us, I mean all around you and me in Amherst, are female poets making reproaches of male
      poets for expecting to be cleaned up after, but I don’t, sometimes, think that that’s what’s happening. The man our
      professor called me just last week a “good student” and an “overachiever,” but the lesson of Quintane, who is open
      about what she considers her quality of “obedience” as well as the overarching one of being a good student, is
      that these crosses can be borne with style; it is its own reward to live. Meanwhile a lady professor said, and
      I wrote this down because it seemed so revelatory, “It’s good for me, so it must be good for my writing,” about
      some living arrangement of hers. Quintane dates the burgeoning of her practice to her implantation in
      Digne, where—after a visit, I can confirm—she considers herself to lead a <i>vie agréable</i>. That’s the secret. For
      my part I recorded Quintane’s gestures. Removing a cat from her lap, welcoming it back, all the while saying
      something apposite.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That line I’ve evoked has been, for me, so memorable for the reason of its setting in a conversation, I would say. It
      takes its special dynamism—more than tonal ambiguity, a tonal polyvalence—from this setting. (Even the title, <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Ultra-Proust</span>, is sonically apt for a book about French literature and its
      kitsch, for the comic duplication of that vowel that is, for a foreign speaker like myself, really
      killer.) <i>Conversion à la littérature</i>—and the perfection of those cognates may have also helped the phrase stand
      out to this Anglophone with vividness—is not the only irresistible phrase of Quintane’s to occur in dialogue. Indeed, the
      depiction of disembodied speakers getting into a pitched and, from the outside, humorous argument about some aspect of
      the politics or <i>philosophy</i> of literature is something of a specialty of hers. One of the marvels of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>Tomates</span> is the speaker’s doing that with Auguste Blanqui, who had a
      brother, Adolphe. Actually, Adolphe and Auguste, who disagreed on whether violence was an appropriate means to
      revolution, are the ones fighting, but they seem to be fighting about Quintane’s approach to the book that
      contains them. “What cowardice”! All this talk, ranging “from Franco to” her festivals, why not “roll up
      a couple of tracts” and stuff them under “your bike seat” … and “your <i>Eternité par les astres</i>,” that would
      be, perhaps, a “ ‘practical guide’ ”? … Ooh there it is! “But the real truth is that you don’t know how to
      read!” … You “want me to think, Auguste,” that “you slipped the plan of attack for the Winter Palace into your description
      of the Milky Way?!” … “You think I’d have” stirred myself “from my low and humid cave” in jail, “at a distance of two
      fingers from death itself, just to write you a poem” …
      <br/>
      <br/>
      They are fighting about taking things literally as well as about political utility, that use value, or not, of
      literature. At issue in this is how to live a life, which Quintane introduces with a phrase she says would be paralyzing
      if offered, offering it, and I, taking the bait, take it up, incorporating it in that French section as an ingredient of
      my inquiry, this phrase about the difference between a “mediocre” existence, “floating, eyeballing it in navigating
      between possibilities” and a “determined” one. You can really fall on your face as well as getting paralyzed and
      eating crow in reading literally, and at Quintane’s I brought up with her, looking around the room, something I’d
      read of Jean-Marie Gleize’s about her, about her sticking up poems all across her walls, something that she
      didn’t, however, visibly, seem to … No, she said, she had never been one for … particularly … Well, I said
      finally, finishing somewhat weakly, perhaps, Quintane was quick to agree, that was only a way of speaking (He was
      writing) that Gleize had.

      <p id="footnote">[1] At the time of his death Christophe Tarkos was 41 as reported by <i>Le Monde</i> and according to Google
