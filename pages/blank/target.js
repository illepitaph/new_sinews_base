      From the driving position, once again I’m adjusting the shade. Recyclical, which is watchful, to say prideful, of my
      hurtling-towards. My gift of my death. What that is my giving. Towards loving. Towards loving my life.

      After visiting home, or perhaps a little prior, a steady off-ness had built in me a fortress until I awoke one
      morning to N.’s startled face in my own. An $850 trip to the emergency room and I’m reminded that panic only
      recedes by great effortlessness, where the story begins, where the will automates the rush of action
      inconclusively, though operative.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Every day a new tremble/ing.

      I’m seeing seeing. I’m writing writing. I’m reading reading. I’m hearing hearing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Like the old fashioned telephone.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“A doubling where there is too much feedback.”</span> A doubling that isn&apos;t circle, but an unbreaking dynastic Line.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The sensory. What feedbacks the senses senses a route backwards toward a second, personalogical recognition where
      everything is a cathedral built by wisps of past effort. Like the old fashioned telephone, we can’t surmise
      its mechanical properties other than the prosthetic use once crossed with the human-divinity plane, where <i>the</i> human is immortal.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For example
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In Charlestown, I held her hand through the streets I was seeing. I was seeing seeing the streets as if the streets
      were a castle built by refractions in the door frame. Even the Monument seemed like something I’d placed there, poking
      my own eye (not the atmosphere).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I was hearing hearing the people streaming aboard Old Ironsides. I held my face in the mist near the old courts. I felt
      hers. My legs promptly gave in to a pain I didn’t register as my own.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Was I breathing this beating?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“Certainty is nothing other than the objective essence itself, that is to say, the way in which we become aware of the
      formal essence is certainty itself.”</span> Spinoza, <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</i></span>. So simple, and yet, so difficult
      to internalize, to remember to deploy—conceptually—when I’m digging digging. Instead of, in the place of. I’m in the
      place of wherein the place-of desists. Certain works of philosophy would take the mind’s inability to focus on
      the objective essence as evidence of it being a symptom of some other unity, thus abandoning it. Spinoza, on the
      other hand, is the one who knows that it is precisely the infiltrative presence of these other “unities” that keeps
      us from focusing on this ever-unwanting task at hand, human freedom.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Oscillation inaugurates—sets going—not the recognition of oneself, but the howl. “If you want to drive a person
      crazy…” Alan Watts wants a bowl of.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The howl. We listen to the music of a certain part of our youth we desire to never leave. This is what is meant
      by a ‘black hole.’ As Keith Reniere used to ask his followers, “What do you lose if you were to stop living
      the way you live now?”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What have you got to lose in forgetting? What has one //
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      got to lose in forgetting?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“I first of all realized that if I abandoned the old ways and embarked on a new way of life, I should
      be abandoning a good that was by its very nature uncertain—as we can clearly gather from what has been said—in favor
      of one that was uncertain not of its own nature (for I was seeking a permanent good) but only in respect of
      attainment.”</span> Spinoza again, with a clarity of spirit one like me could only achieve under the wracked bodily
      strain of nasal steroids—all else sullying, a wet napkin placed over the iron.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I worry worrying. I see myself seeing worrying. Fearish and trembling, sun through the white blinds, from
      the white wall a reflection of tan on the bedsheets I kept kicking. My bloating, the keep. The most important
      thing to consider now now under consideration, unable to ‘let go.’ Become-Kleist. The puppet coming over
      the master like shadows of an air raid. We must, first of all, recover belief in this world.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“[I]t may be that believing in this world, in this life, becomes our most difficult task, or the task of
      a mode of existence still to be discovered on our plane of immanence today.”</span> Deleuze and Guattari—or, here, speaking
      from the double-voice, Deleuze—speaks of an empiricist conversion of the work of philosophy, from
      Hume to James/Peirce, which would require the belief in belief, or calling belief what has customarily been
      described as the process by which something is folded into the body, prehension, demiurge of the platelets. Can
      you hear them howling?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There isn’t anything to be <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>recovered</span> by believing in “this world.” This is of no reactionary order. Rather, what
      is believed is believed in the utility of leading to other belief: of what <i>can</i> be believed. Can we adjust
      the goal posts of what may comprise the <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}>new</span> so as to crack open belief (always <i>once again</i>), is
      the question asked by those in whom I place my intellectual trust, and those to whom my writing—in the spiritual
      sense—is dedicated.

      The bad trip came at a time at which I thought I was becoming one with this person, N., who I loved. A ficus tree
      turned into a dark mobile of rain-inhered dying. To be breathing or seeing was death-defying, and I wasn’t
      sure <span className={styles.grayShadow}>I</span> knew how to do either anymore. It was as if there were fishing lines attached to each muscle in
      my face, reacting to what I felt were the exultations of my own actions recited back to me in hers. Black
      hole. Bad hole. That was that.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With certain drugs, there are no second chances. Or easy ones. I suppose we could have induced ourselves to expel
      the moulded shrooms. She did vomit, later, after nearly choking on a piece of bread.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I was introduced to Lord of the Dance. The day had been planned to be a day of working on the internet. We’d
      driven to Southie to pick up a printer/scanner that didn’t print. Later, its sleek modern design features would
      to us look like the idiosyncratic mouth of Evil, and we treated it so.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The rain had stuck us inside like two pairs of sandals. I had no inclination to have sex. This was the first time
      I’d felt attacked by routine. We just sat on the couch, occasionally becoming looped. In each other’s orbits was
      a profligate wasting-away of one’s presentness, and not even the music winding through the apartment could bring
      us any closer to the bliss we’d encountered down the Cape on some beach of which we no longer even remember
      the name: eating a whole bag of chips, nearly pissing to keep warm, but rolling through the atmosphere with
      a serpent’s muscle, hearts real. A woman came up to the shack in which we were holed only to put a letter
      in the empty mailbox. A few hours later, the same woman arrived to retrieve it.

      Aim sight. From Berryville on down, one sees into a past that’s stuck around. These mid-Cambrian hills referred to
      as mountains, valleys so far below sea-level your ears pop just ascending a stair. N. begs to take a picture in
      front of the vintage Coca Cola mural. Rolled deep into tourist country. Just before crossing the Line, N. gets
      out to piss behind an empty church. I snap a picture unsure of whether CVS will develop graven images such as
      this, her ass popping out from beneath her blouse in the familiar but always shocking bone-shade bone-shape. We’re
      headed to Eureka, land of so many ancestors, aesthetic and real. Touted as “my favorite place on planet Earth,” and
      I stand by that.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      AKA: Little Switzerland. Two Dutch Dames Chocolate Shoppe. History of Klan activities, history of Wiccan
      activities, history of Osage displacement, history of World War I. In Carroll County, the old places like
      this. A movie set sans camera crew. Few know of it, though those who do, assured of its dark, dank mystery, acclaim it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I’d put “Eureka Springs” on the agenda as an open-ended prompting, for exploration. I’d already filled N. in on
      most of the lore—historical, that which precedes me, and my own—such as the haunted Crescent Hotel, the Bourbon St.
      Inn, where Stanford stayed initially when he blew into town white-suited. Any mention of the poet brings to mind
      lines from C.D. and the image of how I suspect .22 holes in a chest would look. As if nothing entered the body
      at all. Negative pimples erupting inward. They say, it’s the force of its trajectory, as well as the swiftness
      with which lead keel-hauls a biological system, that kills the idiot who uses such a small caliber weapon.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We sweat into our shorts, the dinky shop-lined streets where both my parents and my mentors (C.D. and Forrest) undoubtedly
      strolled, post-coitus in new marriage bliss. A honeymoon destination. The first city in Arkansas to issue marriage
      licenses to “queers.” An LGBTQ destination solely based on its being the center around which migration falls, a town
      no one really wants to visit for more than a day, unless you’re in love with each other or God. In the magic shop, the
      kid asks us if either of us know how to skateboard. In the gallery, the man asks us if we know the work of Thomas
      Kinkade. Of-fucking-course we do, we think.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      N. and I stay for 6 hours, though in more love than ever. Leaving not before visiting E. Fay Jones’ Thorncrown
      Chapel, a hidden gem, literally among the pines. <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Where the sun never shines, and you shiver when the cold wind blows</i></span>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Incidentally, this is the location of C.D. and Forrest’s vows. Poets as speech-actors. Reading the pamphlet in pew I
      recognize the fact that the two must have been one of the first couples wedded here, perhaps just a year after its opening.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      E. Fay Jones cites the inspiration of his mentor, Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as Anglo-Saxon architecture. And it’s true, one
      isn’t sure whether they’ve entered the set of Beowulf or Deep Space Nine. A “thin place.” Eric Weiner of the NYT:   <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“locales
      where the distance between heaven and earth collapses and we’re able to catch glimpses of the divine, or the transcendent
      or, as I like to think of it, the Infinite Whatever.”</span> A proper deterritorialization. One alights as the site of what had
      previously been an arbitrary caesura. Is this not the history of the world? Acclamation of glory at the slightest
      indication of the subject’s waning. Architecture: a frozen multitude.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Being <i>in</i> or <i>among</i> a thin place remembers me to the importance thinkers like Deleuze and Foucault (as Nietzsche
      and Spinoza before them) on <i>comportment</i>, the way one carries one’s meat around. Especially in this century this
      strikes me as immediately vital, this century which no longer believes the body other than discursively drawn. Thought
      to have eliminated the mind-body dualism it (our chatter) has made everything mind. Deleuze and Foucault are in some
      sense blameworthy, though through misreadings of their work, undoubtedly. No doubt still to blame. Though comportment (as
      in, repetition is a comportment, from the first page of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Difference and Repetition</i></span>). A position: that’s how it’s felt
      with N. I’m held by a love that has nothing of a beginning or end. Truly as if I came in at the middle, clambering
      through the orchestra pit and onto the stage, the audience full in its emptiness.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On the long drive home (as always, I mistakenly turn onto 13 instead of continuing through Branson West to 160, resulting
      in a much longer trek through the old country, where the old people lived their deaths) mom calls to tell us dinner
      won’t be ready. “I have no energy,” she says, “I’ve been in the ER with Granny all day.” Last night, apparently, Granny
      downed an entire bottle of Lovenox, an anticoagulant. At her age, I assume, there’s not much blood to thin beneath
      such brittle skin. A thin place. Frantic, I grip the wheel. “She’s alright. The doctor says she can leave
      tomorrow. Nothing happened.” Nothing happened. One more thing: “When I told her this is why she needs
      someone to watch over her—because she took all of her pills by mistake—she tells me ‘Maybe I did it
      on purpose, did you ever think of that?’”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Maybe I don’t want to live anymore.” Not ‘maybe I want to die,’ an exhaustion of what’s possible. Maybe I
      don’t want to live anymore, maybe life doesn’t want me. This proliferation of dead cells. I carry around
      this unconscious, this sack of real globlets.
      <br/>

      Jean Luc Nancy, I find out on twitter days after the fact, has passed away. I feel a similar chest-tightening
      when learning of Sophie’s tragic fall from moon-watching. These individuals whose very courage, as it was
      expressed through media not known for courage, offered a glimpse at an action removed from itself as the
      deadening strike.   <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“Poetry <i>itself</i> might be found better,”</span> Nancy
      wrote, <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“where there isn’t any poetry at all...Poetry
      does not coincide with itself.”</span> Eternal return of the same difficulty, that of appearing together. Not of
      appearing as if together but together-appearing, compearance. I’ve been telling myself how the Other stands
      there for me, against the wall of all-else, and I should take note of its budding circle-producing. How
      poetry can be a brick and a garden.

      To draw a territory. MP on love:   <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“to make my outside your inside, and
      vice versa.”</span> To, as GL would
      write, affirm that bodily reaction does not arise from excitation, but that the outside world lends
      evidence for a movement occurring in the deep, we weave a fiction for every pre-game. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“To be exposed
      is to be ‘posed’ in exteriority,”</span> wrote Nancy. An intimate outside, not like one’s childhood
      backyard, but like one’s head of hair.

      Wordsworthian sublime as element of oneself taken place outside of one’s motive, an unreachable tide, staggered
      by the vision of the giant swan. On a beach in Niantic, N. and I sip seltzer down and read to each other, the
      hottest people around, naked in our summer outfits. I’m leaning on my fist and elbow, dreaming of making her
      quiver, on the lookout for loose nipples, sine waves lapping a child. “A child is being lapped.” A lapsus is
      being birthed, and for what? Other than making it difficult.

      I haven’t been able to do anything anything, but seeing myself loving, fucking, as if I were watching myself
      showering, wondering how powerful such a body would be over me. In combat. I had to stop smoking weed in my
      Somerville apartment. Too hot to walk around in, I would vegetate, waking up in a
      spiral. <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Where do we find ourselves</span>… (Emerson). Though now, there’s

      Waking up so cloudy I slap blood out of my mouth in the car, punch my jaw so hard I let go of the steering
      wheel. Yelling into the dash. This is the danger I’m printed on. A trip to regulated life at a desk. A deck
      of emotion on which is laid the granular innate, innately intimate body. Throating the drunk liquid, shoveling
      shit into my gullet, finally sure of some breakdown of bodily softening that could be said to be mine. A few
      mornings of not being able to speak, of holding my ribs, N.’s had enough of it, and drives me to the ER in
      a hurry. I toke before getting into the car, the light at the end of the cartridge flashed, hatred of
      the image intensified, entwined in a chrysalis of fear that in stretching out my arms, the muscles will
      fall from the bone. We drive behind a truck with an advertisement: <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Ur | bane</span>, N. pronounces it “ur-bane.” The
      master of bone. I have fishbowl vision, and this won’t end, even after the medication I’m prescribed kicks
      in, although already I’m remembering believing. Remembering believing in remembering-at-hand. A pin
      emerging, red hot, out of the birthday balloon.

      N. and I take a trip to the Wenham Museum of Child Artifacts. Though when we arrive, a sign
      informs us that it’s closed for repair, for cleaning. Presumably of the toy trains. We look
      in the windows and see nothing other than the specters of what is desired. My mask around
      my chin in the reflection like a blue helmet strap.

      This part of New England is beginning to feel most authentic. Unlike the big port simulacra of

      We drive to Manchester-By-The-Sea in the spirit of the same spontaneous urging that led us this

      my body into its rhythm, but at one I take 10 mg of buspirone and take each step off
      a cliff onto the sidewalk. Side effects: dizziness, fatigue. Barely different from
      the effects of anxiety, though “safer,” unable to climb.

      I’m drinking an Arnold Palmer in such a quaint little place, I feel the movement of the infinitely

      lines such as <span className={styles.grayShadow}>“Everything happens for a reason”</span> (Leibniz), that
      nearly carries me over the edge, head into the glass. And if I were to act on such a motive, would I be
      more in pain or relieved to be breathing fresh air again. I don’t have an answer for it. I feel like I’m
      inhabiting the life of a different human copy, even my shits appear “off.” Come out at a non-Euclidean angle.

      The moment of dream reflection, of reflecting upon what is thought to be recognized as images incorporated
      into the dream, is really dream-dreaming. It’s the inward folding of the force of the dream back into form, which
      it, in fact, didn’t <i>have</i> prior to this formation. Form is supplementary to the dream, the dangerous supplement, although
      it can be said that in the virtual form exists, as links between coils of RNA. The cult is a formal dream of community
      that only “works” under conditions of great secrecy and grace. Such that one can only enter into prayer fully with
      eyes closed, the moment contemplation reaches the status of representation, it suffers a pre-slotted caval of judgment
      that (typically) leads to its dissolution. Or at least its dissolution into the <i>everything else</i>.

      Turkey Hill Lane, or Turkey Hill Place. I sift through the remains of a weekend&apos;s Maps queries for the actual name. Technological c
      urtain of territorialization. Turkey Hill Lane in Hingham, near the Weir River Farm where a woman, commemorated there by an
      art studio, painted a regionally famous landscape, red barn included. In her quotation, she mentions the tree covering, as
      well as the faint scab of the city visible behind (now much more visible, no less a scab). N. and I walk awhile through
      mud to what we thought was more trail, but was only the head we&apos;d misinterpreted, having to backtrack. To trek back. Chiggers
      or something loving me alive. Trying hard to wake myself up to this light. Photo-receptors lagging behind the faciality
      burnish, calibration taking on more than it can to chew daytime.

      Polly Thayer Starr, the painter’s name. One farm, presumed, for one family. Hers. Weir River Farm, just down the hill from
      Turkey Hill. The artist’s father, lawyer and at least <i>intellectual</i> acquaintance of the Transcendentalists, committed
      himself to the swift Charles—as many had done and would do—just after she’d turned 11, a death which would mark the family
      with that familiar stain of Why. Digressively, the discourse surrounding what would now be termed ‘acute depression’ had
      not burgeoned, as it later would, in this very region of America, and so blame had to be left to personal spirit. And as
      societal-academic perspective would come around to rid depression of its teleology (theology), the river dried, sank, overran, and
      eventually collapsed in its modern state to the level of picturesque event, rather than callously insatiable serpent.

      “There are suicides and suicides,” the elder James brother would write, one who was not a stranger to melancholy of his own, and
      who dedicated even his philosophical career to the scientificity of studying the humors. “We, too, as we sit here in our
      comfort, must ‘ponder these things,’ also, for we are of one substance with these suicides, and their life is the life we
      share.” Is life, as it is lived by some, lived? To be lived? Where is the <i>will</i>.

      In James, as with Emerson, we’re always “finding ourselves” someplace. <span className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Where do we find

      rather, as if Life shapes this apprehension as the angle of touch affects both the leg and the lathe.

      I disclosed my predicament in the form of an admission of guilt in the audience of two men I love: M. and B. Two men I love
      dearly, friends who—up to that point—I’d considered adjacent to the type of bond of friendship that says anything anytime, though
      that correction had been misplaced. I misapprehended, on the ride down, how uncallously loving their reactions would be, swift
      and declarative, tumbling in my chest as they spoke. I needed time away, they advised, I needed to see myself as I appeared
      to myself fully naked for a time. Sinking into the couch.

      B.’s apartment overlooks downtown New Bedford, a city of streets leading to water, sluices down which terribly loud flocks
      of seagulls come squawking. His windows, large and imposing from the inside, eternally covered in unwashed fog, are as big
      as backyard movie screens. Upon one visit, I even suggested he begin screening his crowd-favorites for the weekend
      drunkards below: <span className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Brother from Another Planet, Walkabout, Days of Heaven</i></span>. Imagine a red biplane banking left from Shore St. onto
      Broadway, film reflection patterning distortedly its frame as it passes. His guitar and television feature prominently
      in the “space,” as if of a gallery exhibition of a turn of the century (this century) apartment. To be among the people
      I’ve gathered here feels to be among something so undeniably Massachusetts, whether we’re driving down the South Shore
      or fishing along a river in North Hampton. There thrives a familiarity with every part of the state and its history within
      each bred individual. Today we’re headed toward water, a beach on the other side of Dartmouth. Discussions range from
      when will the one of us who is single feel comfortable dating again to Ivy League ratings.

      Control is the center’s supposed background. I had come to realize realizing, feeling as if I could no

      doing. Last Tuesday, I zoomed in with M., a therapist, to unearth—not the poison—but its pathological

      When the three Roche sisters sing in unison “If you go down to Hammond, forget about us,” Hammond refers to Hammond, Florida, and
      us refers to the music industry, or the managers and producers as the intimidatory arms of that institution. Instead of leaving
      for Florida, the sisters, it’s written, stuck around and finished the album, although its best song—<span className={styles.grayShadow}>Hammond Song</span>—with its
      ahead-of-its-time untimeliness (the way the King Crimson guitar line floods and recedes, presaging Nigel Godrich), wasn’t
      written until the end. In a time of reflection. (To reflect upon a period in which one couldn&apos;t hold the line, is there any
      other rationale for literature?) One wonders (me) whether or not they should have scrapped all before it. Instead, the sisters
      tacked the song onto the beginning of the record, as if it had been there all along. Dangerous, beloved supplement. Creation’s
      children always end up shadowy in the mirror.
