        It was in one of those badly lit, bureaucrat-filled, crime-crowned,
        cum-reeking joints that offer Calzada Independencia its distinct flavor
        of decadence where Leobardo’s brother, having suffered celibacy for
        thirty-one years owing to a middling height and protruding hump,
        understood at last that his body could be something more than a prison.
        Penelope was always on his lips, manifesting as a deeply caring and
        thoughtful figure who asked for little; that is, for her pay and nothing
        else. Everyone knew, especially Leobardo, that a maternal disposition in
        one of Ishtar’s daughters cannot obtain if you fail to go beyond
        protocol. Mere pay yields tried-and-true craftsmanship: some handiwork
        and a tightening of the cunt. Verily, Penelope made a Pindar of
        Heriberto, and soon brought out his lavish tendencies, insofar as
        minimum wage and family loans permitted.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leobardo determined Penelope was a coping mechanism that Heriberto had
        excogitated in an instant of despair, and therefore derided the artless
        Pygmalion. Although the case for brotherly love was hard to argue,
        Leobardo certainly imagined, consistent with his devious loyalty to
        time-worn masculinity, that only through his aggressive deflation of
        illusions he would open his brother’s eyes. But words are words,
        penurious stabs at passing air, and even Leobardo’s hebephrenic humor
        could not debark in Heriberto’s inner haven, truculent as it now was to
        all material which brought no memory of viscous hydromancy. Indeed, our
        erstwhile eunuch acquired the bearings of a satrap, bid adieu to
        nosocomial self-consciousness, and dared to call Leobardo an equal. The
        relationship was heating. Words had to be relinquished.
        <br />
        <br />
        Step where you may, there are prerogatives for regulars. No exception in
        Lipsdick: a minute of intense grinding after your underwear were as wet
        as a viene viene’s rag, ribald tattle designed to cement your insider
        status, an improbable hand job among your clueless pals, some coquettish
        slaps to harmonize with the allotted spanking. It is easy to notice that
        all these concoctions, however intimate in execution, were simple
        charades. Leobardo, in his hubristic spell, asked for truth. Who tended
        to his brother? Correct, correct, the sly Heriberto had anticipated an
        intervention and so gave a false name. Lipsdick housed no Penelopes.
        Furthermore, he soliloquized as if she were a soul unbounded by matter,
        a visitation that tickled his cock with the effectiveness of a pagan
        goddess. In this <i>civitas diaboli</i>, you would have been fortunate
        to remember humanity had interests beyond the haptic. Leobardo tried,
        spent, and folded. Plotinian Penelope eluded his coarse sensibility. How
        could she not? Why would such a cock-slanted being find within the
        whorizon the exquisite Phryne, beloved of Apelles, Praxiteles, and
        Hypereides? Why would the lowly devotee of some nameless satyr detect
        among the pornae the sophisticated Leontion, Zoilus of Aristotelians?
        Perhaps a capricious Lais would have made herself known. Perhaps.
        Against Larentina, however, he had to approach me.
        <br />
        <br />I hasten to add that my involvement sprang from a need for
        dallying, not from any genuine interest in the fraternal tug-of-war. A
        tyrannical older brother who lords it over an embryonic anchorite teases
        us with mythic undertones, yes, but the eventual rebellion that is
        ignited through a growing self-worth surely evokes another trinket for
        Americana aficionados. Therefore I set aside the speculative leisure in
        which it is my custom to hibernate. Did not Machiavelli forge his shrewd{" "}
        <i>Discorsi</i> in the amiable and aimless atmosphere of the Orti
        Oricellari, where conspirators, poets, and philosophers alike reveled in
        the hidden harmonies of the vernacular? What of Ficino and his
        Neoplatonic Florentine Academy, so debonair as to outspread and fill
        each member’s heart? Or Boucicaut’s Order of the Green Shield with the
        White Lady, dedicated to something <i>other</i> than the “honor, estate,
        reputation and praise of all women and damsels of noble lineage”? Let us
        found our <i>Cours d’Amour</i> whenever possible, and trust that the
        spoken word will engrave within once and for all the fleeting
        experience. But we must gather first.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cunning though Heriberto was, he ultimately fixated on traits that
        betrayed a slender silhouette. On the basis of this seemingly meager
        datum, four-fifths of Lipsdick was discounted. Your gluttonous civil
        servant has always had a predilection for continual reminders of his
        daily feasts: nothing will do short of callipygian damsels with enough
        rack for the sudden erotomastia. What is more, upstanding members of
        society that they are, they would not think of stuffing their
        triple-chinned faces into their steaks; at night, nevertheless, they can
        stuff them for minutes on end into a handsomely paid ass. And let us
        keep in mind their rebellious counterparts, those cap-wearing gentlemen
        who, peanut-shaped though they be, must have tributes to their impetuous
        manhood throughout the day. These proud bearers of our animal past favor
        defenseless cries for help and pleading eyes, but they can manage to
        sleep if a zaftig dancer growls smutty nonsense about their cocks almost
        puncturing their insides. Lipsdick cared for these abliguritious
        customers. The stray students who giggled at the sight of nudity and
        whispered “tits” with bated breaths, the hoodied bachelor who looked
        askance in fear of finding his equally lonely colleagues, the reluctant
        drunks who had an innocent time at the karaoke bar yet felt there must
        be more to a night of fun were all merely tolerated. The five exceptions
        to contemporary standards of lust were at their disposal. I turned to
        them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Inés in her inglenook, gratifier of nikhedonia, angled her eyes and
        opened them out of pot-induced engrossment, for she knew the prevailing
        addiction to minima and disbelieved of cuntcentration. A grin, a slow
        dance, and a remote spread. I could see those gentlemen on repeat
        skeptical of their luck. Here you had a long pair of legs attached to a
        comatose stunner: the crude dream implied in countless jokes. Inés did
        not talk, legs swinging and trembling as bait. Inés waited and stuck to
        her inner life. No, no, she would certainly not allow anomalies. Thus I
        sat and made no further inference. She slept. Susana, antipode at order,
        hurried toward my cock, mumbling <i>donkey horse tripod impaler</i>,
        stripping with violence her outmoded lingerie, baroque pleaser to eye
        and ear. I had to act the tease. She played with her nipples, licked and
        bit her lip, stared with consuming ardor. Blistering lust as sedative
        was the strategy. So again I would not hear a meaningful word. In point
        of fact, I masturbated out of politeness, but impatience grew. A
        makeover, she insisted. Noticing the cumulative bitterness, I went with
        that beloved defilement of porn-glutted teenagers and dog-natured hunks.
        I was then hurried out. Melanie succumbed to the garishness of her lair.
        The walls were covered with posters of Rafael Inclán, Alfonso Zayas,
        Jorge Rivero, Chatanuga, and Tun Tun; two bedside tables had small lamps
        in the shape of ficheras; the bed aspired to roundness. She was the
        youngest yet. Perhaps nineteen? Submission, aggression, and now
        regression. Giddy and grumpy, resolutely inarticulate, she came and went
        enthralled by the echoes of her screeching laughs and curses. Taunts to
        toil and triumph. Like in the movies. Cut. Why follow in the footsteps
        of curmudgeons who link lust and lewd literacy, who sweat for a
        nostalgic hard-on? Heriberto, as was customary in those crass
        productions, would have been lampooned and offered a last-minute pity
        fuck—the origins of a Weininger, not of a bard. Dalia began with a
        story. In her freelance days, a certain vigorous youth from Providencia
        (the type who enjoys his Neronian escapades into the famously marginal
        localities, where he is greeted like the royal rake he feels himself to
        be and repasts on the dubious choices aroused by romantic delusions of
        ascent in our perilous social scale) contacted her. Since her clientele
        lived off pills and handouts, she was delirious. A lifetime of
        full-blooded fucks sprinkled with many-colored wads passed through her
        eyes. Her circle had its legends, and Providencia figured prominently as
        a place of miracles (the rich there were modelled after the sweet,
        compassionate Luis Fernando de la Vega Montenegro). They met at his
        apartment, and he stated the terms of their engagement: Mondays she
        would arrive, make herself at home, enter his room, and fuck him while
        he pretended to be asleep; Sundays she would pretend to be asleep. Odd
        but all-around comfy. She then understood the euphemism. On Sundays, he
        was brusque whenever she moved and quickly stopped her. She once opened
        her eyes, and he lost his erection. Doubtless our Periander preferred
        cold ovens. But for her own sake she defaulted to the more charitable
        interpretation; she defaulted, that is, until the little Catholic
        upbringing her wastrel parents managed to spit out between bouts of
        turpentine inhalation possessed her body in primeval spasmodic chills
        that evolved into a refined and abject guilt, which soon required
        expiation through violence. Although I am a man of great poetic fancy, I
        never shun the protocols of reason: the bleak turn that followed struck
        me as mythmaking of an erotic cast. She apparently got hold of some
        blood bags through a friend and bathed the would-be embalmer in the
        liquid of his dreams. She went on and on and on. Was there a moral here?
        Some sort of warning? I couldn’t tell. But I could tell the red lighting
        was meant to match the plot. Heriberto would have resented the
        intimations of any paraphilia. So on Tatiana I set hopes that
        immediately caught fire. Tatiana, the incandescence of your nondescript
        professionalism burned through the layers of impersonal method and
        marked the insularity easily traced in the contours of my being.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet I am of Pericles’ strain and would convince whoever witnessed my
        fall of a failure of perception. As occurred presently, I convinced
        myself. Improvident despite austerity, desperate through lack of
        revelations, I had to choose an adequate temper for Leobardo’s
        imagination. Tatiana too bland, Dalia too off, Melanie too wry, Susana
        too crass. Inés, she of the hazy mood, dislocate, was ideal, for her
        tenuous existence, hard to delimit, would be lumped by Leobardo in the
        deviate realities of introversion. Certainly, this spurious distinction,
        which has served to shackle moody tempers to a caricature that
        highlights only the worst in themselves, was a favorite of his.
        <br />
        <br />
        I touched upon Inés and her reticence. Let it be known that I am no imp
        who lives to saddle the wretched with additional weights. No, that is
        not the course of my instinctual drives. Were it so, doubt not I would
        follow it with great dignity and flair, and thus I would have seduced
        Inés in order to thrust three outsiders further to the margins just for
        the thrill. To be clear, I am an imp who unsettles the stupor-scented,
        with qualification—I should be unsettled as well, I should feel the
        moderate shock that compels pause. The swashbuckling immoralist must
        crash. There is no place for him; he belongs to the interstices. “All
        luxury ends in slavery: even luxuriation in the purest love to the most
        sacred being.” I would leave Inés intact and barely involved.
        <br />
        <br />
        Three more visits and a rough-hewn reconstruction of the brotherly feud
        (a simple use of epithets: cunt-crazy Leobardo against spirit-loving
        Heriberto) exacted enough sympathy for Inés to agree to a benign
        intervention, which would consist in nothing more than standing on guard
        while Leobardo assailed her with preposterously doltish questions (why
        are you fucking him, why do you keep going, do you like it, don’t you
        feel sorry) and perhaps some commandments (stop fucking my brother, stop
        answering, stop coddling). Having put all my trust in this infatuating
        jade, I enlightened Leobardo on the evancalous nature of his brother’s
        deipnosophist and blessed him on his charette. He did not seem as eager
        as before. I suppose that of his kaleidoscopic impulses there was only
        left at this point a combination of saving face and the need for
        revenge. A natural development in one who suckled on the factual. Not
        quite the climax I expected for my sleuthing, yet fitting: was it not
        mostly a tour in which I honored chastity?
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, one’s genius is not easily fooled. Hickey, with constrained heart,
        saw his father’s tears and heard his earnest words; he even resolved to
        seek a path hostile to his dissolute inclinations. Do you remember the
        amount of time he managed? Never more than a week. Then you had him
        toasting with criminals, crashing a boat in a drunken rapture, and
        mounting the lover of a supercilious noble. And there was no
        alternative. The world is a cutthroat mass of possibilities, but all are
        not open; <i>au contraire</i>, most are adamantine bolted doors. It
        matters little. We are perfectly aware of our desires, though reluctant.
        We can cross and instantiate. The silly geese who stand awestruck before
        the myriad lives that are lived intensely and have no unruly urge to
        carve their own must be destined for spectatorship. There are crowds
        upon crowds without soul-searing impulses. Rejoice, then, if your
        genitalia have plans other than the adjustments called for by your
        hesitating mind, which, listen not to the dualists, is no separate
        substance. Now, one’s genius is persistent. And its enablers are always
        there. Leobardo was unconvinced, aggrieved. He spoke of masculine
        intuitions, but really. One’s genius is also perceptive.
        <br />
        <br />A last postprandial visit, alas! I looked into the neocratic
        regime and witnessed its subtle yet iron rule. From the glistening,
        half-corroded central pole, where a dissociated middle-aged blonde vied
        to outdo the twenty-year-old money-machine that preceded her, down to
        the cornered comessation of adolescents, where a mildly bored
        thirty-year-old slammed her cheeks against the birthday boy, I saw it
        all; for, except the wizened bartender, no person kept aloof of the
        alluring petrichor that promised discharge. Hyperactive, bloody-eyed
        traffickers weaseled their way to their sole piss-glazed territories:
        there, adding a layer of sumptuous accent, rolled in the capacious
        wallet and its sycophantic cortege; here, smog-showered and
        sooty-limbed, a beggar stumbled in his stupor against the sweaty
        bouncer, too much a prey of inaccessible perceptions to ask for alms:
        hundreds of bodies, kinetic and worn-out, came tumbling in with bulging
        peduncles, and went tumbling out again with doused languid flowers. Do
        you know whether this incessant <i>immunditia</i>, <i>macula</i>,{" "}
        <i>turpitudo</i>, <i>ignominia</i> will ever cease its thrust? From
        violence, onwards to violence! This is humanity stripped to its
        mercenary core. Are they all not potential foot soldiers prowling the
        streets in search of the weary and crushed so as to debase them further
        and gain some short-lived energy? Lipsdick, the very tabernacle that
        preserves callousness in times of skittish peace. Here one sees a living
        link to the brutalities which ever trail over our march. Laughable,
        certainly, that generic chastisement of bygone periods in which
        battalions pillaged everything in sight and as recreation stuck a
        linstock through half a village’s ass, or in which a common thug forced
        Palioly’s Pear into an unsuspecting civilian’s mouth while having no
        recollection of its key ever existing, or in which tyrants ordered their
        devoted servants into brazen bulls simply to kick-start the anguished
        bellows. The permutations of pain increase in sophistication, and we are
        unwilling and unable to go back. Ah, but you had me there! Regal in my
        detachment, scanning the caliginous sublime, erect, meeting filth with
        dispassion, I let the surplus approach. And then, abrupt, Inés and the
        anagnorisis in her dazed smile. She knew. The finagler duped. Done. Riot
        cried aloud. Just as there abound quacks, skinners, wetworkers,
        burglars, embezzlers, backyard breeders, double-crossers, impersonators,
        flim-flams, money mules, mochileros, pornographers, poachers, pimps, so
        too martyrs and saints bloom. Here, again, resounded the basso continuo
        of my life: the lost with the lost; the upright with the rest. All
        zealotry of conversion as transient as our nocturnal emissions.
