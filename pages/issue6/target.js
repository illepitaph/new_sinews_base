      From the driving position, once again I’m adjusting the shade. Recyclical, which is watchful, to say prideful, of my
      hurtling-towards. My gift of my death. What that is my giving. Towards loving. Towards loving my life.

      After visiting home, or perhaps a little prior, a steady off-ness had built in me a fortress until I awoke one
      morning to N.’s startled face in my own. An $850 trip to the emergency room and I’m reminded that panic only
      recedes by great effortlessness, where the story begins, where the will automates the rush of action
      inconclusively, though operative.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Every day a new tremble/ing.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      I’m seeing seeing. I’m writing writing. I’m reading reading. I’m hearing hearing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Like the old fashioned telephone.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “A doubling where there is too much feedback.” A doubling that isn't circle, but an unbreaking dynastic Line.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The sensory. What feedbacks the senses senses a route backwards toward a second, personalogical recognition where
      everything is a cathedral built by wisps of past effort. Like the old fashioned telephone, we can’t surmise
      its mechanical properties other than the prosthetic use once crossed with the human-divinity plane, where <i>the</i> human is immortal.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For example
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In Charlestown, I held her hand through the streets I was seeing. I was seeing seeing the streets as if the streets
      were a castle built by refractions in the door frame. Even the Monument seemed like something I’d placed there, poking
      my own eye (not the atmosphere).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I was hearing hearing the people streaming aboard Old Ironsides. I held my face in the mist near the old courts. I felt
      hers. My legs promptly gave in to a pain I didn’t register as my own.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Was I breathing this beating?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Certainty is nothing other than the objective essence itself, that is to say, the way in which we become aware of the
      formal essence is certainty itself.” Spinoza, <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</i></span>. So simple, and yet, so difficult
      to internalize, to remember to deploy—conceptually—when I’m digging digging. Instead of, in the place of. I’m in the
      place of wherein the place-of desists. Certain works of philosophy would take the mind’s inability to focus on
      the objective essence as evidence of it being a symptom of some other unity, thus abandoning it. Spinoza, on the
      other hand, is the one who knows that it is precisely the infiltrative presence of these other “unities” that keeps
      us from focusing on this ever-unwanting task at hand, human freedom.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Oscillation inaugurates—sets going—not the recognition of oneself, but the howl. “If you want to drive a person
      crazy…” Alan Watts wants a bowl of.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The howl. We listen to the music of a certain part of our youth we desire to never leave. This is what is meant
      by a ‘black hole.’ As Keith Reniere used to ask his followers, “What do you lose if you were to stop living
      the way you live now?”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What have you got to lose in forgetting? What has one //
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      got to lose in forgetting?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “I first of all realized that if I abandoned the old ways and embarked on a new way of life, I should
      be abandoning a good that was by its very nature uncertain—as we can clearly gather from what has been said—in favor
      of one that was uncertain not of its own nature (for I was seeking a permanent good) but only in respect of
      attainment.” Spinoza again, with a clarity of spirit one like me could only achieve under the wracked bodily
      strain of nasal steroids—all else sullying, a wet napkin placed over the iron.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I worry worrying. I see myself seeing worrying. Fearish and trembling, sun through the white blinds, from
      the white wall a reflection of tan on the bedsheets I kept kicking. My bloating, the keep. The most important
      thing to consider now now under consideration, unable to ‘let go.’ Become-Kleist. The puppet coming over
      the master like shadows of an air raid. We must, first of all, recover belief in this world.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “[I]t may be that believing in this world, in this life, becomes our most difficult task, or the task of
      a mode of existence still to be discovered on our plane of immanence today.” Deleuze and Guattari—or, here, speaking
      from the double-voice, Deleuze—speaks of an empiricist conversion of the work of philosophy, from
      Hume to James/Peirce, which would require the belief in belief, or calling belief what has customarily been
      described as the process by which something is folded into the body, prehension, demiurge of the platelets. Can
      you hear them howling?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There isn’t anything to be <i>recovered</i> by believing in “this world.” This is of no reactionary order. Rather, what
      is believed is believed in the utility of leading to other belief: of what <i>can</i> be believed. Can we adjust
      the goal posts of what may comprise the <i>new</i> so as to crack open belief (always <i>once again</i>), is
      the question asked by those in whom I place my intellectual trust, and those to whom my writing—in the spiritual
      sense—is dedicated.

      <i>I love you more every day</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The bad trip came at a time at which I thought I was becoming one with this person, N., who I loved. A ficus tree
      turned into a dark mobile of rain-inhered dying. To be breathing or seeing was death-defying, and I wasn’t
      sure <i>I</i> knew how to do either anymore. It was as if there were fishing lines attached to each muscle in
      my face, reacting to what I felt were the exultations of my own actions recited back to me in hers. Black
      hole. Bad hole. That was that.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With certain drugs, there are no second chances. Or easy ones. I suppose we could have induced ourselves to expel
      the moulded shrooms. She did vomit, later, after nearly choking on a piece of bread.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I was introduced to Lord of the Dance. The day had been planned to be a day of working on the internet. We’d
      driven to Southie to pick up a printer/scanner that didn’t print. Later, its sleek modern design features would
      to us look like the idiosyncratic mouth of Evil, and we treated it so.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The rain had stuck us inside like two pairs of sandals. I had no inclination to have sex. This was the first time
      I’d felt attacked by routine. We just sat on the couch, occasionally becoming looped. In each other’s orbits was
      a profligate wasting-away of one’s presentness, and not even the music winding through the apartment could bring
      us any closer to the bliss we’d encountered down the Cape on some beach of which we no longer even remember
      the name: eating a whole bag of chips, nearly pissing to keep warm, but rolling through the atmosphere with
      a serpent’s muscle, hearts real. A woman came up to the shack in which we were holed only to put a letter
      in the empty mailbox. A few hours later, the same woman arrived to retrieve it.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      Aim sight. From Berryville on down, one sees into a past that’s stuck around. These mid-Cambrian hills referred to
      as mountains, valleys so far below sea-level your ears pop just ascending a stair. N. begs to take a picture in
      front of the vintage Coca Cola mural. Rolled deep into tourist country. Just before crossing the Line, N. gets
      out to piss behind an empty church. I snap a picture unsure of whether CVS will develop graven images such as
      this, her ass popping out from beneath her blouse in the familiar but always shocking bone-shade bone-shape. We’re
      headed to Eureka, land of so many ancestors, aesthetic and real. Touted as “my favorite place on planet Earth,” and
      I stand by that.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      AKA: Little Switzerland. Two Dutch Dames Chocolate Shoppe. History of Klan activities, history of Wiccan
      activities, history of Osage displacement, history of World War I. In Carroll County, the old places like
      this. A movie set sans camera crew. Few know of it, though those who do, assured of its dark, dank mystery, acclaim it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I’d put “Eureka Springs” on the agenda as an open-ended prompting, for exploration. I’d already filled N. in on
      most of the lore—historical, that which precedes me, and my own—such as the haunted Crescent Hotel, the Bourbon St.
      Inn, where Stanford stayed initially when he blew into town white-suited. Any mention of the poet brings to mind
      lines from C.D. and the image of how I suspect .22 holes in a chest would look. As if nothing entered the body
      at all. Negative pimples erupting inward. They say, it’s the force of its trajectory, as well as the swiftness
      with which lead keel-hauls a biological system, that kills the idiot who uses such a small caliber weapon.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We sweat into our shorts, the dinky shop-lined streets where both my parents and my mentors (C.D. and Forrest) undoubtedly
      strolled, post-coitus in new marriage bliss. A honeymoon destination. The first city in Arkansas to issue marriage
      licenses to “queers.” An LGBTQ destination solely based on its being the center around which migration falls, a town
      no one really wants to visit for more than a day, unless you’re in love with each other or God. In the magic shop, the
      kid asks us if either of us know how to skateboard. In the gallery, the man asks us if we know the work of Thomas
      Kinkade. Of-fucking-course we do, we think.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      N. and I stay for 6 hours, though in more love than ever. Leaving not before visiting E. Fay Jones’ Thorncrown
      Chapel, a hidden gem, literally among the pines. <i>Where the sun never shines, and you shiver when the cold wind blows</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Incidentally, this is the location of C.D. and Forrest’s vows. Poets as speech-actors. Reading the pamphlet in pew I
      recognize the fact that the two must have been one of the first couples wedded here, perhaps just a year after its opening.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      E. Fay Jones cites the inspiration of his mentor, Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as Anglo-Saxon architecture. And it’s true, one
      isn’t sure whether they’ve entered the set of Beowulf or Deep Space Nine. A “thin place.” Eric Weiner of the NYT: “locales
      where the distance between heaven and earth collapses and we’re able to catch glimpses of the divine, or the transcendent
      or, as I like to think of it, the Infinite Whatever.” A proper deterritorialization. One alights as the site of what had
      previously been an arbitrary caesura. Is this not the history of the world? Acclamation of glory at the slightest
      indication of the subject’s waning. Architecture: a frozen multitude.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Being <i>in></i> or <i>among</i> a thin place remembers me to the importance thinkers like Deleuze and Foucault (as Nietzsche
      and Spinoza before them) on <i>comportment</i>, the way one carries one’s meat around. Especially in this century this
      strikes me as immediately vital, this century which no longer believes the body other than discursively drawn. Thought
      to have eliminated the mind-body dualism it (our chatter) has made everything mind. Deleuze and Foucault are in some
      sense blameworthy, though through misreadings of their work, undoubtedly. No doubt still to blame. Though comportment (as
      in, repetition is a comportment, from the first page of <span
      className={styles.grayShadow}><i>Difference and Repetition</i></span>). A position: that’s how it’s felt
      with N. I’m held by a love that has nothing of a beginning or end. Truly as if I came in at the middle, clambering
      through the orchestra pit and onto the stage, the audience full in its emptiness.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On the long drive home (as always, I mistakenly turn onto 13 instead of continuing through Branson West to 160, resulting
      in a much longer trek through the old country, where the old people lived their deaths) mom calls to tell us dinner
      won’t be ready. “I have no energy,” she says, “I’ve been in the ER with Granny all day.” Last night, apparently, Granny
      downed an entire bottle of Lovenox, an anticoagulant. At her age, I assume, there’s not much blood to thin beneath
      such brittle skin. A thin place. Frantic, I grip the wheel. “She’s alright. The doctor says she can leave
      tomorrow. Nothing happened.” Nothing happened. One more thing: “When I told her this is why she needs
      someone to watch over her—because she took all of her pills by mistake—she tells me ‘Maybe I did it
      on purpose, did you ever think of that?’”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Maybe I don’t want to live anymore.” Not ‘maybe I want to die,’ an exhaustion of what’s possible. Maybe I
      don’t want to live anymore, maybe life doesn’t want me. This proliferation of dead cells. I carry around
      this unconscious, this sack of real globlets.
      <br/>

      Love nox. Bring on the night-love.
