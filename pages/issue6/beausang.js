      <StandardProse>
        Idler, illiterate and door-to-door salesman Hugh Twomey was elected to
        Waterford City Council in the 1985 local elections proposing firstly to
        keep the old gas metres for the people who want them, reducing Garda
        numbers along the border (‘The place of the Gardaí is on the streets of
        Ireland, if Maggie Thatcher wants a border there, she can police it
        herself’) and finally, the development of waste ground on John’s Hill
        into a park for children and old people.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hugh was kept going by people who would give him a pound’s recognition,
        the generosity of homes in which he was always welcome for a bit of
        lunch and the few quid he got each week from Fianna Fáil TD Paudy
        Buckley, for doing circuits of the city for three hours each week-day,
        bearing on his shoulders a sandwich board, one side advertising
        Buckley’s betting shop, the other, his pub. The sandwich board had
        nothing to say on Buckley’s Memorials, which sold gravestones, graveside
        accessories and was managed by one of Buckley’s three sons. Buckley’s
        taking on of Hugh as an employee was of a part with his philanthropy; he
        had fostered a young woman from the county home in Dungarvan run by the
        Sisters of the Good Shepherd and put her to work as a maid in his
        seven-bedroom house.
        <br />
        <br />
        Buckley was invited to give a speech on the occasion of the tenth
        anniversary of the opening of Waterford’s Institute of Technology on the
        lower floor of the library; bookshelves and desks were cleared to make
        space for ten tables and a four-course gala dinner. The content of
        Buckley’s speech should have been straightforward, everyone for coming
        thanks, this happy occasion, young people are the future, but Buckley
        instead held forth on the Irish legal profession, the stranglehold which
        they held over Irish political life, with their non-transparent
        practices, judges doling out favours, payments to cronies, rate-fixing,
        squatting on vacant land, making things harder for squeezed
        working-class businessmen such as himself, the many times on which he
        had spoken on this issue in Leinster House, the enthusiasm for judicial
        reform and tackling vested interests that Charlie Haughey shared with
        him.
        <br />
        <br />
        Buckley secured a nomination for his eldest son, Paudy Buckley Junior,
        as the second Fianna Fáil candidate running in the 1985 local elections.
        Buckley spoke to <i>The Waterford People</i>, a staunch outlet with
        unrivalled weekly distribution, of the historic resonance of this
        election, given Buckley himself had made this seat his own at the
        beginning of his political career. This story was edged from the
        headlines onto page four, in favour of a photograph of Twomey, bearing
        his familiar scutcheon emblazoned, not with Buckley’s business
        portfolio, but his own name, likeness and slogan, ‘The People’s Choice!’
        In the paperwork Twomey submitted to city hall he identified himself as
        an ‘advertising agent’, a position Buckley’s nullified on hearing that
        Twomey was to appear on the ballot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Homes in Lismore, Ballybeg and Mount Pleasant had leaflets through their
        doors on which Twomey lifted aloft a pint of Guinness and a thumbs-up
        before Buckley seemed to have even engaged the lock cylinder of his
        electoral machine. Buckley’s bookies carried odds on the local
        elections, putting Donal O’Rourke (FF) on 9/1, Michael Raleigh (FG), a
        local barrister, on 8/1 and Buckley Jnr. 1/2 to secure the third seat
        ahead of the Labour candidate Billy Dunphy. Twomey’s odds were listed on
        the first day as 100/1; before these odds were trimmed and the ticket
        closed to all future bets, five separate men had put £1000 on Twomey.
        From that point on Patrick Buckley’s nickname—‘the idiot son’—would
        enter into more general circulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the second week of the campaign Twomey again made the front page of{" "}
        <i>The Waterford People</i>, with news of the statement Guinness had
        issued emphasising that they had nothing to do with Twomey’s campaign
        and did not endorse him. A senior Fianna Fáil man from the area was
        anonymously quoted in the article as saying though he would love some of
        Twomey’s backers as PR men, he does not think he has a chance of being
        elected.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——I’ll give it to him this. He has a well-run campaign. Very beautifully
        produced.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.grayShadowProse}>
          Voters of Waterford you have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to write
          yourself into the chapters of history.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          While all the parties blame each other for getting us into the mess we
          are in you can finally have something to boast about after eight
          hundred years.
          <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Voters tuning in to Waterford Local Radio, a pirate radio signal which
        presented more community-focused news stories and advertising found the
        regular rotation of Donna Summer or Celine Dion interrupted by a
        four-piece céilí band playing a song called ‘Twomey’s the Man’:
        <span className={styles.grayShadowTwo}>
          <br />
          <br />
          The boys are plotting in the something
          <br />
          To make the politicians squeal
          <br />
          They’ve found the man to fit the bill
          <br />
          Who can it be but Twomey
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        In response to the question posed on the eve of the poll—when Twomey
        appeared on the back of an articulated lorry at The Mall with marching
        bands, cheerleaders and hundreds of supporters—as to whether or not
        prominent members of the legal profession in Waterford were behind his
        campaign, Twomey said he had nothing to say.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——To what do you attribute all your success here this evening?
        <br />
        <br />
        ——The people of Waterford want me on the council because they like me
        and because they know me! It’s as simple as that.
        <br />
        <br />
        O’Rourke was elected at the first count with 1508 first preferences.
        Over the next number of counts, the Communist Party candidate, four
        Independents, second, third and fourth Gaelers were eliminated, until
        Raleigh and Dunphy came in on the eleventh count, Twomey on the twelfth
        and Buckley Junior just 118 preferences behind him.
        <br />
        <br />
        The occasion of Twomey’s accession to the seat, a rank outsider facing
        down a political dynasty and winning, was described in the national
        press as one of the biggest electoral upsets in the history of the
        state.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——Do you have any ambitions now that you have taken office?
        <br />
        <br />
        ——The closure of Ford’s and the tyre factory amid the recession here in
        Waterford has made me sick and I intend to go to Brussels and to the
        United States to see if I can work out any sort of deal with anyone
        willing to come here and to create jobs.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——How do you feel about some of the local politicians who you’ve beaten
        here today?
        <br />
        <br />
        ——I’m not going to criticise anybody.
        <br />
        <br />
        When Twomey was asked if he had any further comments to make, one of his
        supporters moved vociferously to obstruct the press, for which Twomey
        rebuked him. Twomey’s supporters then chanted here we go here we go here
        we go and lifted him on their shoulders out onto the street, to a
        victory rally at The Mall with hundreds of people, where he posed for
        photographs and sang The Wolfe Tones’ ‘We’re On The One Road’ before
        being whisked away in a black Mercedes to a party in the city centre.
        <br />
        <br />
        Paul McCarthy, Twomey’s election agent said he was only disappointed
        that Twomey had not topped the poll. Pressed on who the vested interests
        behind Twomey’s campaign were Mr. McCarthy said he had acted as Twomey’s
        election agent, had made no secret of that or of his support for him.
        <br />
        <br />
        When asked for comment at the setback to his son’s political career as
        well as the heavy losses his betting shop suffered, all Buckley wished
        to say was that there were a large number of bets placed by members of
        the legal profession. In response to questions, Dr. Raymond St. O’Neill
        said the Waterford Law Society was not in any way involved in Twomey’s
        election, despite the insinuations and accusations which have been
        appearing on radio and television.
        <br />
        <br />
        At an impromptu speech at the opening of a new building at Waterford GAA
        club, Buckley accused Dr. O’Neill and the legal profession of the most
        outrageous blackguardism and said that if there are people in Waterford
        who have engaged in skulduggery or subterfuge than he is for the first
        time, ashamed to be a Waterford man.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——Twomey is a nice and gentle man who I have had many dealings with over
        the years, both socially and from the point of view of my business terms
        but with the greatest of respect to him he has no contribution to make
        to public life and as he has been known to say himself doesn’t know the
        first thing about politics or about policy. I have not yet proved this
        definitively, but I am saying now that I am damn well out to find out if
        there are solicitors involved in this and that there will be hell to pay
        if there is and that they are blackguards. I have no respect for the
        electorate after this, they have a lot of responsibility for this, they
        are full of entitlement and demands and they have taken all the goodies
        that are being doled out by the corporation, housing estates, parks and
        by this government and they have no respect for the people who have
        worked hard for this city who pay their taxes and get nothing back in
        return for it. I do not wish to talk Mr. Twomey down, I often meet him,
        but he has no experience of governance. He is as entitled as anyone else
        to stand for election but he is being pushed into governing by people
        who could not give a damn. The people responsible did not have the guts
        to stand for election themselves and to tell us what it is that they
        really wanted, they are playing Hitlerite games with politics and with
        Waterford’s business community, the record of myself and of my family is
        superb, we enjoy a record that you would not find anywhere else in the
        world, I would not be surprised if my son did not leave politics and
        public life for good now. Twomey the sandwich man has been used coldly
        and callously for the ends of others and I can name names in the Dáil at
        any times that I choose and I plan to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        After taking office Twomey travelled to New York and along the east
        coast of the United States to collect money, at first for those in
        Waterford who have been left unemployed after the closing of the Ford
        car factory and as he began to find that Republican rhetoric went down
        better with American audiences, ‘the struggle for Irish freedom’. On his
        return to Waterford, many spoke with admiration of Twomey’s new set of
        teeth.
        <br />
        <br />
        Twomey’s leaflets produced for the 1987 general election contained:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.leafletText}>
          1. quotes from many of the incumbent candidates’ speeches in which
          they said that the people of Waterford were a disgrace, that people
          should be ashamed of themselves, that if Twomey stood for a fifty-five
          seater constituency in a civilised country, he would not get a seat.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. That his favourite people were Mother Theresa, Jack Lynch, Pope
          John Paul, Che Guevara, John Stalker, Bob Geldof, Frankie Walsh.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. That when he was 15 years old his father died, that his family was
          evicted from their home, that his mother had a nervous breakdown, died
          in an institution, that he was separated from his siblings who were
          taken into care, that he himself had been left unloved in the streets,
          has only been re-united with them with his entry into local government
          after almost four decades in which he has known only loneliness, that
          he has slept in doorways, ditches, parks, poorhouses, that he has
          lived hand-in-hand with the most abject in Irish society but has never
          given up, has never done harm to anyone, that there were many
          hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of people like him in the
          history of this nation, illiterate, forced to emigrate, the hungry
          masses yearning to breathe free, that he was witness to how the
          American dream could work.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. That he would put new bathrooms into all corporation houses and
          flats.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. That the president should use the executive power granted to him in
          the constitution to dissolve the Dáil, to liquidate this election and
          to create a national government.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. That the bloodsucking of Irish society had to end
          <br />
          <br />
          7. That Irish abattoirs, slaughterhouses and meat factories should be
          opened to end the export of live cattle
          <br />
          <br />
          8. that the Seanad should be abolished
          <br />
          <br />
          9. that the office of the president should be abolished
          <br />
          <br />
          10. that TDs and civil servants should pay PAYE like the rest of us
          <br />
          <br />
          11. that Ryanair should be moved to Waterford
          <br />
          <br />
          12. that All-Ireland finals would no longer be played in Croke Park
          <br />
          <br />
          13. that Section 31 should be repealed to end the IRA once and for all
          through rational argument on the national airwaves
          <br />
          <br />
          14. that he would donate his Dáil salary to Cork charities to be
          decided upon by the church hierarchy
          <br />
          <br />
          15. that the number of TD’s in every constituency should be reduced by
          one.

        <br />
        <br />
        A few hundred attended Twomey’s polling night rally. He polled 684
        votes, 0.8% of the ballot.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1991, Twomey talked to the Worker’s Party about standing for them in
        Waterford.
        <br />
        <br />
        The phone rang in Buckley’s constituency office. Mags was off sick and
        Buckley walked from behind his desk to pick up the receiver. Buckley
        could not say hello, his throat felt stuck, gripped. The momentum of his
        vocal cords too stalled as he tried to clear the blockage, Buckley was
        able only to investigate the extent of his paralysis while listening to
        the sound of someone taking a bite of something, chewing.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——There is a wall. When you come off the M7. On your left. It’s gray.
        That wall is you. You’re the whitewash on it. You’re nothing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Buckley’s feet lifted from the floor, the receiver and the outlet on the
        wall drifted with him towards the starch panels of the drop ceiling.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——If asked your wife would agree that having sex with you is not unlike
        the style of football that Jack Charlton will bring to the Irish
        football squad. Running. Running. Running.
        <br />
        <br />
        The voice on the phone grew fingers and pawed into parts of Buckley’s
        mind and memory; a father with a bullwhip, its handle lacquered and
        brown revenging itself on something white and hanging, maybe by a limb,
        from the oak in the back garden.
        <br />
        <br />
        ——Every night for the rest of your life you will dream of everyone you
        have ever know in every place you have ever been.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fingers reached further, into the circuits of the brain-stem and its
        outlays, its ground-work to excavate circles within circles, human lives
        measured in railway lines.

        In an article entitled ‘A rock and a hard place: Prospects for the
        two-and-a-half party system in the Republic of Ireland’ published in the
        quarterly journal <i>European Elections and Representation</i>, lecturer
        and psephologist in NUI Galway’s department of political science Liam

          Since the 2011 general election, Fianna Fáil’s days as the natural
          party of government in the Republic seem to have come to an end.
          However, there a clear path ahead for Fine Gael, heir presumptive to
          political hegemony, with their more Atlanticist outlook and more
          competent avatars of political stability untrained by associations
          with corruption and the economic populism of the past, drawn as they
          tend to be from the propertied and privately educated ranks of
          society. We should not however regard this moment as any sort of
          definitive break or rupture; along the road to this juncture it is
          possible to identify many instances in which the electorate—often
          under acute economic stress—have sought to administer the political
          class with a kick. As the poet Patrick Kavanagh once said, of such
          local disputes was Homer’s Iliad written.

        Twomey died in 2005. The local tradition of leaving a bottle of porter
        at his grave in Kilbarry Cemetery is still observed today.
