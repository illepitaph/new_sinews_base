   <span className={styles.grayInverse}>JULIAN MITHRA</span> hovers between genders and genres, border-mongering and -mongreling. An
   experimental archive, <strong><cite>Unearthingly</cite></strong> (KERNPUNKT) excavates forgotten
   spaces. <strong><cite>If the Color Is Fugitive</cite></strong> (Nomadic Press) historically intervenes in
   frontiers. <strong><cite>KALEIDOSCOPE</cite></strong> (Ethel Press) flexes transembodiment against alphabetic
   constraints. They’re cobbling together a record of trans*masculinity in a speculative Philadelphia, 1829, where
   natural scientists rival evangelical millenarianists for insight into the sublunary and sublime.
