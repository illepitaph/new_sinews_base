        <p className={styles.getteLineation}>When I write the lines it comes out in a child’s voice</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>And the child’s voice sounds like the mouth was stuffed with something— confetti,
  cotton, dust, sock, apple, duct tape, Stoffer’s, cranberries, fists, locusts, toilet paper, unsharpened pencils,
  pogs, kinetic sand, dry leaves, soil (wet or caked), feathers (obviously), mattress springs, tulle and tinsel,
  polymers and lead, Jupiter’s seventh moon, the cartographic remains of a failed vacation, its fold-up road atlas,
  corner of a month-old large supreme pizza box from Little Caesar’s, chalk dust from sidewalk hopscotch, three
  neon orange tyrannosaurus rex arranged in a tea party pattern on the edge of the neighbor’s roadside garden, 3
  copies of Poetry magazine (still in plastic), a tiny ceramic cat that bears no resemblance to the real cat you
  miss and its attempt to fill that fur hole, one locust (real) hanging from a magnolia branch whose leaves
  occasion to a sunset color at the edges, and are plucked in the moment of attention drifted from the locust to
  the leaves, coffee coasters that might be bathroom tiles, the overwhelm of material detail, the shape of innocuous
  objects that try to fill that fur hole, fur, fur, and the murmurs of others...</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>The voice I think I am writing in is much more sophisticated, raspy even, the
  one that has succumb to the chemical world & inhales its sentencing to produce a sound too low to hear but can be
  felt as nausea, the innocuous appliance is a killer (this sound is a matter of time)</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Curlie-cues of throaty resignation that come out in-audible and supplicating
  so that the air confuses it for gratitude</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>But I am not grateful, I think</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>it as ambient as air and innocuous as air that seems breathable enough</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Or nice enough, like bubbles and desk fans blowing directly into your eyeballs on

  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>
When I wake up I watch Marguerite Duras’ <span className={styles.greenShadow}><cite>India Song</cite></span> and I write
down one line that seems to have hit reviewers at the time it goes “lepers burst like sacks of dust”</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>
But the reviewer or the translator of the film got it wrong—the reviewer said “like sacks of grain,” and I wonder
about the difference
</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>In the first the leper is more like dust</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>In the second the leper is more like the sack—I have never heard of a sack of
dust, but it’s easier to imagine it bursting</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>A leper standing for a someone too porous to keep to herself when the world got in
her particulate matter spattering all over the nearest solid container</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>Or outward as solar diffusion that cute poets like to write about twirling in the rays
coming in through the morning’s window</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>One day you burst like a sack of dust</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>Other days the grain spills out and it is a waste of a harvest hoarded for a future
hurtled toward but easefully ignored</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>The technofuturist pours hot pink dye all over your head to coordinate with hot pink
sweatpants and the pink shirt with a cute pink bra</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>Hello to all my fans! you say, I love you, I love my fans...</p>
<p className={styles.getteLineation}>In <span className={styles.greenShadow}><cite>India Song</cite></span>, the camera pans over her
red wig, her jewelry, the piano and an incessant gesture of incense—too-long shots of the Palais Rothschild painted
everywhere in a sick green, and I wonder if it is Paris Green, the color of Napoleon’s wallpaper that killed him by
slow inhalation in his sleep</p>

      layout={`responsive`} alt="Still Two From Marguerite Duras’ India Song"/></div>

  <div className={styles.poemContainer}>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>I think of this in the context of household toxins and what it means to keep
  a house virus-free and to what extent a surface is shared if its reality isn’t—the line between dream and not,
  virus and loved ones, sickness and health, Napoleon withering by breathing green wallpaper or Napoleon figure of
  colonial power, the evil of stillness or the evil of movement</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>When he dreamt did he dream of winning the Napoleonic wars and rising through
  the military ranks after the French Revolution to be a general at age 24</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Did he dream his luscious colonies’ return to slavery?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Did he dream of the detail of the Louisiana Territory?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Did he dream of the mouths of Saint-Dominigue that spat him out like
  a symptom of respiratory droplets?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Spat him like tobacco, sugarcane, unripe banana etc.?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Spat him like he spat arsenic, orgeat syrup, potassium tartrate, calomel, copper in
  the wallpaper and household items of the Longwood house, where he spent his exile in the clutches of Britain&apos;s East
  India Company?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Spat him like a locust spits as it covers the sky in swarms as a symptom of
  thoughtless human tearing up the topsoil, scraping the mantle-deep grasses that turned wheat into dust (too far West
  and ahead in time)?</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>The house bursts like a sack of grain but it dreams in imperial time</p>
  <p className={styles.getteLineation}>This is the message of the film it seems, we surround the afflicted with posthumous
  gossip</p>

    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>No one speaks they just loll around performing dull movements to this song while
    people gossip</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>At the beginning of the film it seems the voices are the ghosts, but then we
    realize their disembodiment is what’s alive in the film, their assumptions are what lives</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>While the figures move in time slow as an image</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Anne-Marie, the “promiscuous wife of the French ambassador in India” is dead</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>She grew bored with the Empire and decided to die</p>

    <div className={styles.poemContainer}>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>In the film she moves through time as a gelatinous membrane</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Mendicant because the beggar is described as her mirror Mendicant because no one moves
    that slow without desire for another time or timing</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>She can hold herself in the membrane</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>She can puncture it or herself with mendicant gestures that follow the banality
    of daily tasks and their absurd questions: “Does this dish belong on this shelf or that shelf?” “To turn the laundry
    machine on, do you press in the button or turn it?” “Is this towel used for the dishes or the body?” “How do I use
    the lawn mower?” “How much to pay the lawn mower guy?” “How many paper towels do we need?” “What brand of butter
    do you buy?” “Can disposable gloves be used twice?” “Do you happen to have any batteries?” “Is the milk old?” “Are
    the beans old?” “Is the Diet Dr. Pepper old?” “Where is the soap for the floor?” “Where is the soap for
    the dishes?” “Where is the soap for the body?”</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>If soap is what kills the lipid layers among lepers is it possible to live
    in a bubble?</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Is it possible to wear soap gloves or to leave some soap on your hands so that if
    you share a surface that has the virus the leftover soap will fight it off?</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>If I drink bleach will I be cured of my dust?</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Maybe it’s not a vaccine we need maybe it’s more bubbles, bubble
    parties for everyone</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>You daydream a scenario in which the Great Pacific Garbage Patch might be
    fashioned to create plastic bubbles for everyone to move around in like hazmat suits at a grocery store</p>
    <p className={styles.getteLineation}>Napoleonic ghosts figure the distance between this daydream and a vaccine,
    the Paris Green of malaria prevention</p>
