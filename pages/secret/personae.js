      <StandardProse>
        The reflection in the antique mirror trembles, a manic energy blurring
        the lines of her face almost imperceptibly on the polished surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        But she can see it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Head tilts downward, eyes pan over the contents of the glass-topped
        vanity before her: rouge, combs and brushes, scattered lipsticks, and a
        squat black pot of kohl. What here could protect against the dissolution
        of her face, what could fix her features in place to stop that blurring
        trembling erasure she sees beginning in the mirror?
        <br />
        <br />
        Her hand reaches for the kohl and she presses her finger into the solid
        mass, swirling and swirling until it forms a thick paste warmed by her
        skin. She considers the slick black that now coats her fingers.
        <br />
        <br />
        The mirror shows the kohl-blackened hand reaching up and a sudden flash
        of teeth as she begins rubbing, darkening her teeth with broader and
        broader strokes. Soon she moves beyond just teeth, dipping fingers back
        into the kohl to smear more across the border of her mouth, tasting waxy
        nothing and feeling the fine sand-crunch of grit. The face that regards
        her in the mirror is exaggerated now, mouth elongated and teeth lost to
        the kohl.
        <br />
        <br />
        The reflection&#8217;s eyes shift to her hair.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kohl-stained hand now pulls a honeyed-gold teak comb through long
        black hair. If she presses down, firmly, teeth digging into the pale
        white of her scalp, she can stop the trembling, she is certain of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        How many times did she need to run the comb through her hair?
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>One hundred strokes</i>, her mother&#8217;s voice comes to her now,{" "}
        <i>One hundred strokes each night</i>, <i>my daughter</i>,{" "}
        <i>and your hair will be so beautiful</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The comb flashes briefly in the mirror, hovering above the point of her
        widow&#8217;s peak before it bites down again, catching bright flashes of red
        that cake each tooth for a split second before disappearing further into
        a black cascade. She long lost count of how many times she has dragged
        the comb through her hair. And still her hand keeps its mechanical
        movement up, down, through.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Yes</i>, <i>mother</i>,{" "}
        <i>but how many times before I am beautiful</i>?
        <br />
        <br />
        As her eyes fix on her image in the mirror, she sees the hair clump,
        thick coils beginning to curl upwards in disarray no matter how hard she
        presses down. The comb no longer moves fluidly and she has to wrench it
        out several times. She takes no notice of the droplets of red that
        spread across the stark white of her nightgown. She continues combing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>How many times</i>?
        <br />
        <br />
        The comb suddenly catches, sharp teeth caught on a wet matted knot,
        slipping out of her hand. Without missing a beat her hand compulsively
        continues its path, fingers digging in and moving around the comb now
        embedded in the slick mass that seems to grow with each pass. She
        reaches up with her other hand, clawing through her hair with
        increasingly jerky motions. As her hands rake through the full length of
        her hair, they came away with handfuls of glistening red-black coils.
        <br />
        <br />
        In one sudden move she gathers her hair in both hands, wringing it
        firmly. A thick rivulet of blood drips from the ends, pooling onto the
        tiled floor.
        <br />
        <br />&#8220;<i>And</i>, <i>cut</i>!&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko instantly relaxed, holding out her red-black dripping hands to the
        assistant that dutifully appeared at her side with a towel. Off to the
        side the director gives her a preliminary thumbs up, the bright stage
        lights glinting off thick tortoise-shell glasses while the rest of the
        crew bustled around the set.
        <br />
        <br />
        Amid the activity, Suiko suddenly smelled a thick, acrid tang in the
        air, like the pressure of the sky bearing down just before a storm
        breaks.
        <br />
        <br />
        She instinctively glanced around.
        <br />
        <br />
        From behind the production crew and the large camera rig situated
        several feet from her mark she saw a single glassy eye glinting within a
        sheet of long, scraggly hair.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko had been skeptical about taking the role when her agent approached
        her about a reimagining of the Yotsuya kaidan some boutique American
        studio was putting together.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;The casting director told me they&#8217;re making it a point to cast Japanese
        speaking actors for all the roles and it seems like they&#8217;ve managed to
        fill out most of the cast. All they need is someone to play Oiwa.&#8221; He
        looked meaningfully here at Suiko, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a few influential
        movies with older women protagonists in the U.S., so they&#8217;re attempting
        to age Oiwa up for this and they think you would be perfect.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in her trailer, Suiko sat at her own vanity and considered her face
        in the mirror, now devoid of the thick paste of makeup, stage blood, and
        smeared kohl from the scene.
        <br />
        <br />
        It had been several decades since Suiko had decided to try her hand at
        aging mortally. She had known that it would be risky for a being like
        her to be in the public eye for so long, even if she kept her true
        nature hidden. Yet, Suiko found the prospect of such a dedicated
        performance utterly irresistible—a tanuki living as a naturally aging
        human pretending to be other humans on film and stage.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Method acting taken to an entirely new level</i>, she had thought
        grandly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her current face had settled with the graceful weight of six human
        decades, the slight pouching here and there, the softness of jowls and
        cheeks, the series of horizontal creases that folded when she lifted her
        eyebrows, all meticulously and lovingly crafted from years of
        painstaking practice. The deep, cheerful crinkling of skin around her
        eyes radiating out towards her temples when she smiled was her favorite
        touch.
        <br />
        <br />
        As she was pulling up her hair into a bun, the scent of murky brackish
        water flooded the trailer and she repressed a groan. <i>Not again</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        A hunched figure materialized in one corner of the trailer, a ragged
        kimono hung on her frail frame and pooled at her feet. A sheet of long
        black hair hanging limply over part of her face, which tilted slightly
        from a neck that hung at an unnatural angle. Suiko turned to face the
        apparition.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Well?&#8221; She asked, trying to keep her tone even.
        <br />
        <br />
        The figure adjusted itself to cast its gaze toward Suiko and let out a
        bubbling, choked laugh.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I have seen better.&#8221; It said, its voice reverberating within the small
        confines of Suiko&#8217;s trailer, the sound bouncing off the walls like a
        stone clattering to the bottom of a well.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Can you lower your voice please, Oiwa.&#8221; Suiko said with a wince,
        reflexively reaching up to her ears. She forgot how grating it was to
        speak with the dead.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost let out a gurgling sigh, but pitched her voice lower.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your performance today was adequate.&#8221; Oiwa said, &#8220;Certainly there has
        been improvement over the last several weeks. Though why the
        playwright—&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;—screenwriter—&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Why the <i>writer</i> insists on forcing the angle of madness is beyond
        me. I find it quite tedious that my supposed madness always remains the
        central focus for most of these stories. Even now, when I am to be
        portrayed as an older woman, the madness remains when the events that
        have ostensibly caused that madness would have occurred nearly forty
        years before. Is the presumption that I have not found my own peace even
        into old age?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko was used to Oiwa&#8217;s pontifications by this point and knew it was
        best to simply let things run its course. Suiko herself had been alive
        long before the murders that occurred in Yotsuya Ward, watching the
        legend morph first hand from the Yotsuya zotan, a book presented as
        something supposedly written by an official from within the ward, to the
        plays and rakugo performances that had made Oiwa&#8217;s story so famous. It
        was a far more robust canon than most of the stories she had come across
        for those of her own kind. A bulk of those stories depicted tanuki as
        almost exclusively male with huge scrotums, for heaven&#8217;s sake, and Oiwa
        had grievances against complex character depictions in kabuki plays and
        movies? How so many of the ghosts flitting around felt so entitled to
        their stories long after they had passed was beyond her.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why you fuss about all this,&#8221; Suiko finally cut in,
        &#8220;You&#8217;re one of the most well-known ghosts and you&#8217;ve inspired so many
        other stories. There are even shrines erected in your name throughout
        Tokyo! Surely that must count for something?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost hung silently in the clammy air for a moment, thin tendrils of
        mist coalescing faintly around her.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;These stories do not feel quite right,&#8221; Oiwa said, her voice now the
        gentler trickle of a creek, &#8220;I believe it is because of the humans
        themselves who were trying to portray me—how could they possibly get it
        right? I had hope that a tanuki actress would be able to do something
        different.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;And I am, aren&#8217;t I? You have to admit the bit with the kohl on the face
        and the fight against the dissolution of being was pretty good.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost offered a spasming grimace that Suiko decided to interpret as
        a smile.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Yes, you do manage to capture something of what I imagine, even if it
        appears to be accidental at times.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Well, maybe we could achieve your artistic vision more quickly if you
        haunted the director, or any member of the crew, rather than me.&#8221; Suiko
        said with some irritation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Oiwa&#8217;s laugh bubbled up one last time as she dissolved fully back into
        the air.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        There are no mirrors here nor any gleaming surface at all to catch her shape as she 
        moves down the hallway. There are no lights to cast her form in sharp relief against 
        the oak-paneled walls, just a faint glow that seems to follow her wherever she glides. She
        cannot even feel the smooth tile beneath her feet. Was it simply too cold to feel her feet 
        her hands her body? Surely there was something of her here, something that moves, something 
        that perceives the space around her. 
        <br />
        <br />
        In the distance she hears the soft, intermittent beating of a drum, its rhythm weaving 
        through the eerie piping strains of a flute. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Something propels her forward, an impulse that drags her down the long hall to peer in 
        each open door. What, or who, calls to her? 
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the doors is nearly closed and from behind it are the sound of voices, hushed and 
        hurried. She pauses, listening. The voices muddle together before eventually pulling apart 
        and while she cannot tell what they say, she recognizes some of them now: it is her 
        husband, two of his close friends, and the neighbor.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why would her husband invite company without telling her? 
        <br />
        <br />
        She tries to push through the doorway to get a better look, but she is now suddenly 
        immobile, her back pressing up near the ceiling opposite the door. Around her is that 
        soft halo of warm light and she can see the faint shadows of what must be her body 
        struggling to be free of the wall, of the corridor, of whatever is pinning her 
        aloft. In desperation she reaches out a hand, clawing at the wall around her, and 
        tears out thick chunks of panelling that clatter to the floor. She screams with her 
        mouth wide open and it is the dry sound of tearing paper. 
        <br />
        <br />
        From within the room she hears a shout, sees the rush of movement as a man swiftly 
        opens the door. It is Kaiho, one of her husband&#8217;s friends. His eyes rove the hall 
        before he pushes the door open fully to step out. 
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Did you hear that, Iemon?&#8221; He asks nervously, eyes drifting to the jagged pile of 
        panelling and fine scraps of paper that lie in a heap on the floor before moving up 
        to the gouged marks in the wall, then up to the ceiling to look her in the face. His 
        eyes meet hers and he screams, tumbling backwards in his haste to get away. Before 
        she can speak he convulses violently, clutching desperately at his chest. He lets 
        out one final cry and he is dead.
        <br />
        <br />
        She feels her rasping breath catch in her chest, the round cavity created by the bamboo 
        ribbing feels far too tight. As she struggles her mouth tears open wider, a ragged 
        horizontal cut that allows the light to pour out and illuminate the corridor more brightly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her husband rushes to the doorway, peering wide-eyed at the corpse of his friend lying 
        contorted in the hall. When his eyes finally look upon where her torn paper crepe form 
        hangs, he looks straight through her.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your movement is still completely wrong!&#8221;
        Oiwa&#8217;s voice and its echo buzzed in Suiko&#8217;s head, making her teeth stand on edge. 
        <br />
        <br />
        She was growing weary of this haunting and of the smothering dampness that clung to the 
        trailer whenever Oiwa paid her a visit. 
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;The director would beg to differ,&#8221; Suiko said tensely from the couch, a heating pad 
        warming the small of her back. The team had initially wanted to use a series of ropes 
        and pulleys against a green screen backdrop to achieve the hallway scene. She had 
        managed to convince them otherwise, focusing instead on how she held her body hunched 
        and how she shuffled her feet fluidly across the polished floors to create 
        the impression of weightlessness. 
        <br />
        <br />
        The director had been thrilled with her performance, raving about the impact of practical 
        effects. 
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;No, no, no. Too much bulk, too much being,&#8221; Oiwa insisted, &#8220;There is 
        still too much to be believable. No one with any self respect would see this performance
        as anything more than a cheap sham. You must do more than rely on old kabuki stage tricks!&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko sighed, rubbing at the tension pounding in her temples.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;And how exactly do I lessen my being?&#8221; She asked, &#8220;I am still very alive 
        and corporeal, so there is not much I can do about being embodied. Besides, I&#8217;m much closer 
        to achieving whatever perfection you are after than any other human actor would be, aren&#8217;t 
        I? Why isn&#8217;t this good enough for you?&#8221; As she spoke, she felt her frustration 
        mounting, &#8220;You&#8217;re lucky I&#8217;m even listening to you! What right do you have to come in 
        here and dictate how to play this role?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;You are portraying me.&#8221;

        &#8220;This is just a character, Oiwa, and unfortunately for you they aren&#8217;t interested in 
        creating a pseudo-documentary of what happened in Yotsuya Ward three hundred years ago, even 
        if such a thing were possible.&#8221; Suiko snapped, &#8220;I understand that your story is all 
        you have left, but you can&#8217;t honestly believe you have any ownership over it now. None of us 
        have any say in how we&#8217;ve been depicted. Look at what happened to my friend, the fox, look at 
        how those like her have been demonized for centuries. She never had any say when someone would 
        throw her out of her village simply because they had their own ideas about what a fox was. She 
        only survived by hiding who she was for most of her lives.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your friend still had the chance to be whoever she wanted to be, even when others 
        tried to dictate her story for her.&#8221; Oiwa&#8217;s voice rose with her agitation, pounding
        off the trailer walls like a churning sea, &#8220;She chose to go along with the story 
        written for her and therefore suffered the consequences.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko stood up abruptly, squaring off with the ghost.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;You and I both know it&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221; She hissed, &#8220;You 
        have no idea what those like her, like me, have gone through.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Forgive me if I feel little sympathy for you long-lived beings. If you do not enjoy the 
        life you live, you are able to begin anew. If you do not like the body you have, you create 
        something anew. If you end up loving someone who does not love you in return, you can find 
        love anew. On and on you can begin again unless you are foolish enough to get yourself 
        killed. How many lives have you lived until you became Morinaka Suiko, star of the stage 
        and screen? Hundreds? And yet you criticize me for wishing for some control over the one 
        story of my life that has circulated centuries after I died.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost fixed its single watery eye at her, the rush of rage that swirled to its milky 
        surface dissolving just as quickly back into an impenetrable black.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I admit, though, I had imagined a tanuki, of all creatures, would be able to perfect 
        this role by now.&#8221; Oiwa said snidely. Despite herself, Suiko bristled at those words.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean?&#8221;
