      <StandardProse>
        The reflection in the antique mirror trembles, a manic energy blurring
        the lines of her face almost imperceptibly on the polished surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        But she can see it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Head tilts downward, eyes pan over the contents of the glass-topped
        vanity before her: rouge, combs and brushes, scattered lipsticks, and a
        squat black pot of kohl. What here could protect against the dissolution
        of her face, what could fix her features in place to stop that blurring
        trembling erasure she sees beginning in the mirror?
        <br />
        <br />
        Her hand reaches for the kohl and she presses her finger into the solid
        mass, swirling and swirling until it forms a thick paste warmed by her
        skin. She considers the slick black that now coats her fingers.
        <br />
        <br />
        The mirror shows the kohl-blackened hand reaching up and a sudden flash
        of teeth as she begins rubbing, darkening her teeth with broader and
        broader strokes. Soon she moves beyond just teeth, dipping fingers back
        into the kohl to smear more across the border of her mouth, tasting waxy
        nothing and feeling the fine sand-crunch of grit. The face that regards
        her in the mirror is exaggerated now, mouth elongated and teeth lost to
        the kohl.
        <br />
        <br />
        The reflection&#8217;s eyes shift to her hair.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kohl-stained hand now pulls a honeyed-gold teak comb through long
        black hair. If she presses down, firmly, teeth digging into the pale
        white of her scalp, she can stop the trembling, she is certain of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        How many times did she need to run the comb through her hair?
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>One hundred strokes</i>, her mother&#8217;s voice comes to her now,{" "}
        <i>One hundred strokes each night</i>, <i>my daughter</i>,{" "}
        <i>and your hair will be so beautiful</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The comb flashes briefly in the mirror, hovering above the point of her
        widow&#8217;s peak before it bites down again, catching bright flashes
        of red that cake each tooth for a split second before disappearing
        further into a black cascade. She long lost count of how many times she
        has dragged the comb through her hair. And still her hand keeps its
        mechanical movement up, down, through.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Yes</i>, <i>mother</i>,{" "}
        <i>but how many times before I am beautiful</i>?
        <br />
        <br />
        As her eyes fix on her image in the mirror, she sees the hair clump,
        thick coils beginning to curl upwards in disarray no matter how hard she
        presses down. The comb no longer moves fluidly and she has to wrench it
        out several times. She takes no notice of the droplets of red that
        spread across the stark white of her nightgown. She continues combing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>How many times</i>?
        <br />
        <br />
        The comb suddenly catches, sharp teeth caught on a wet matted knot,
        slipping out of her hand. Without missing a beat her hand compulsively
        continues its path, fingers digging in and moving around the comb now
        embedded in the slick mass that seems to grow with each pass. She
        reaches up with her other hand, clawing through her hair with
        increasingly jerky motions. As her hands rake through the full length of
        her hair, they came away with handfuls of glistening red-black coils.
        <br />
        <br />
        In one sudden move she gathers her hair in both hands, wringing it
        firmly. A thick rivulet of blood drips from the ends, pooling onto the
        tiled floor.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;<i>And</i>, <i>cut</i>!&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko instantly relaxed, holding out her red-black dripping hands to the
        assistant that dutifully appeared at her side with a towel. Off to the
        side the director gives her a preliminary thumbs up, the bright stage
        lights glinting off thick tortoise-shell glasses while the rest of the
        crew bustled around the set.
        <br />
        <br />
        Amid the activity, Suiko suddenly smelled a thick, acrid tang in the
        air, like the pressure of the sky bearing down just before a storm
        breaks.
        <br />
        <br />
        She instinctively glanced around.
        <br />
        <br />
        From behind the production crew and the large camera rig situated
        several feet from her mark she saw a single glassy eye glinting within a
        sheet of long, scraggly hair.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko had been skeptical about taking the role when her agent approached
        her about a reimagining of the Yotsuya kaidan some boutique American
        studio was putting together.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;The casting director told me they&#8217;re making it a point to
        cast Japanese speaking actors for all the roles and it seems like
        they&#8217;ve managed to fill out most of the cast. All they need is
        someone to play Oiwa.&#8221; He looked meaningfully here at Suiko,
        &#8220;There&#8217;s been a few influential movies with older women
        protagonists in the U.S., so they&#8217;re attempting to age Oiwa up for
        this and they think you would be perfect.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in her trailer, Suiko sat at her own vanity and considered her face
        in the mirror, now devoid of the thick paste of makeup, stage blood, and
        smeared kohl from the scene.
        <br />
        <br />
        It had been several decades since Suiko had decided to try her hand at
        aging mortally. She had known that it would be risky for a being like
        her to be in the public eye for so long, even if she kept her true
        nature hidden. Yet, Suiko found the prospect of such a dedicated
        performance utterly irresistible—a tanuki living as a naturally aging
        human pretending to be other humans on film and stage.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Method acting taken to an entirely new level</i>, she had thought
        grandly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her current face had settled with the graceful weight of six human
        decades, the slight pouching here and there, the softness of jowls and
        cheeks, the series of horizontal creases that folded when she lifted her
        eyebrows, all meticulously and lovingly crafted from years of
        painstaking practice. The deep, cheerful crinkling of skin around her
        eyes radiating out towards her temples when she smiled was her favorite
        touch.
        <br />
        <br />
        As she was pulling up her hair into a bun, the scent of murky brackish
        water flooded the trailer and she repressed a groan. <i>Not again</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        A hunched figure materialized in one corner of the trailer, a ragged
        kimono hung on her frail frame and pooled at her feet. A sheet of long
        black hair hanging limply over part of her face, which tilted slightly
        from a neck that hung at an unnatural angle. Suiko turned to face the
        apparition.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Well?&#8221; She asked, trying to keep her tone even.
        <br />
        <br />
        The figure adjusted itself to cast its gaze toward Suiko and let out a
        bubbling, choked laugh.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I have seen better.&#8221; It said, its voice reverberating
        within the small confines of Suiko&#8217;s trailer, the sound bouncing
        off the walls like a stone clattering to the bottom of a well.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Can you lower your voice please, Oiwa.&#8221; Suiko said with a
        wince, reflexively reaching up to her ears. She forgot how grating it
        was to speak with the dead.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost let out a gurgling sigh, but pitched her voice lower.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your performance today was adequate.&#8221; Oiwa said,
        &#8220;Certainly there has been improvement over the last several weeks.
        Though why the playwright—&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;—screenwriter—&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Why <i>the writer</i> insists on forcing the angle of madness is
        beyond me. I find it quite tedious that my supposed madness always
        remains the central focus for most of these stories. Even now, when I am
        to be portrayed as an older woman, the madness remains when the events
        that have ostensibly caused that madness would have occurred nearly
        forty years before. Is the presumption that I have not found my own
        peace even into old age?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko was used to Oiwa&#8217;s pontifications by this point and knew it
        was best to simply let things run its course. Suiko herself had been
        alive long before the murders that occurred in Yotsuya Ward, watching
        the legend morph first hand from the Yotsuya zotan, a book presented as
        something supposedly written by an official from within the ward, to the
        plays and rakugo performances that had made Oiwa&#8217;s story so
        famous. It was a far more robust canon than most of the stories she had
        come across for those of her own kind. A bulk of those stories depicted
        tanuki as almost exclusively male with huge scrotums, for heaven&#8217;s
        sake, and Oiwa had grievances against complex character depictions in
        kabuki plays and movies? How so many of the ghosts flitting around felt
        so entitled to their stories long after they had passed was beyond her.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why you fuss about all this,&#8221;
        Suiko finally cut in, &#8220;You&#8217;re one of the most well-known
        ghosts and you&#8217;ve inspired so many other stories. There are even
        shrines erected in your name throughout Tokyo! Surely that must count
        for something?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost hung silently in the clammy air for a moment, thin tendrils of
        mist coalescing faintly around her.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;These stories do not feel quite right,&#8221; Oiwa said, her
        voice now the gentler trickle of a creek, &#8220;I believe it is because
        of the humans themselves who were trying to portray me—how could they
        possibly get it right? I had hope that a tanuki actress would be able to
        do something different.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;And I am, aren&#8217;t I? You have to admit the bit with the kohl
        on the face and the fight against the dissolution of being was pretty
        good.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost offered a spasming grimace that Suiko decided to interpret as
        a smile.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Yes, you do manage to capture something of what I imagine, even
        if it appears to be accidental at times.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Well, maybe we could achieve your artistic vision more quickly if
        you haunted the director, or any member of the crew, rather than
        me.&#8221; Suiko said with some irritation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Oiwa&#8217;s laugh bubbled up one last time as she dissolved fully back
        into the air.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        There are no mirrors here nor any gleaming surface at all to catch her
        shape as she moves down the hallway. There are no lights to cast her
        form in sharp relief against the oak-paneled walls, just a faint glow
        that seems to follow her wherever she glides. She cannot even feel the
        smooth tile beneath her feet. Was it simply too cold to feel her feet
        her hands her body? Surely there was something of her here, something
        that moves, something that perceives the space around her.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the distance she hears the soft, intermittent beating of a drum, its
        rhythm weaving through the eerie piping strains of a flute.
        <br />
        <br />
        Something propels her forward, an impulse that drags her down the long
        hall to peer in each open door. What, or who, calls to her?
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the doors is nearly closed and from behind it are the sound of
        voices, hushed and hurried. She pauses, listening. The voices muddle
        together before eventually pulling apart and while she cannot tell what
        they say, she recognizes some of them now: it is her husband, two of his
        close friends, and the neighbor.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why would her husband invite company without telling her?
        <br />
        <br />
        She tries to push through the doorway to get a better look, but she is
        now suddenly immobile, her back pressing up near the ceiling opposite
        the door. Around her is that soft halo of warm light and she can see the
        faint shadows of what must be her body struggling to be free of the
        wall, of the corridor, of whatever is pinning her aloft. In desperation
        she reaches out a hand, clawing at the wall around her, and tears out
        thick chunks of panelling that clatter to the floor. She screams with
        her mouth wide open and it is the dry sound of tearing paper.
        <br />
        <br />
        From within the room she hears a shout, sees the rush of movement as a
        man swiftly opens the door. It is Kaiho, one of her husband&#8217;s
        friends. His eyes rove the hall before he pushes the door open fully to
        step out.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Did you hear that, Iemon?&#8221; He asks nervously, eyes drifting
        to the jagged pile of panelling and fine scraps of paper that lie in a
        heap on the floor before moving up to the gouged marks in the wall, then
        up to the ceiling to look her in the face. His eyes meet hers and he
        screams, tumbling backwards in his haste to get away. Before she can
        speak he convulses violently, clutching desperately at his chest. He
        lets out one final cry and he is dead.
        <br />
        <br />
        She feels her rasping breath catch in her chest, the round cavity
        created by the bamboo ribbing feels far too tight. As she struggles her
        mouth tears open wider, a ragged horizontal cut that allows the light to
        pour out and illuminate the corridor more brightly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her husband rushes to the doorway, peering wide-eyed at the corpse of
        his friend lying contorted in the hall. When his eyes finally look upon
        where her torn paper crepe form hangs, he looks straight through her.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your movement is still completely wrong!&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Oiwa&#8217;s voice and its echo buzzed in Suiko&#8217;s head, making her
        teeth stand on edge.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was growing weary of this haunting and of the smothering dampness
        that clung to the trailer whenever Oiwa paid her a visit.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;The director would beg to differ,&#8221; Suiko said tensely from
        the couch, a heating pad warming the small of her back. The team had
        initially wanted to use a series of ropes and pulleys against a green
        screen backdrop to achieve the hallway scene. She had managed to
        convince them otherwise, focusing instead on how she held her body
        hunched and how she shuffled her feet fluidly across the polished floors
        to create the impression of weightlessness.
        <br />
        <br />
        The director had been thrilled with her performance, raving about the
        impact of practical effects.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;No, no, no. Too much bulk, too much being,&#8221; Oiwa insisted,
        &#8220;There is still too much to be believable. No one with any self
        respect would see this performance as anything more than a cheap sham.
        You must do more than rely on old kabuki stage tricks!&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko sighed, rubbing at the tension pounding in her temples.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;And how exactly do I <i>lessen my being</i>?&#8221; She asked,
        &#8220;I am still very alive and corporeal, so there is not much I can
        do about being embodied. Besides, I&#8217;m much closer to achieving
        whatever perfection you are after than any other human actor would be,
        aren&#8217;t I? Why isn&#8217;t this good enough for you?&#8221; As she
        spoke, she felt her frustration mounting, &#8220;You&#8217;re lucky
        I&#8217;m even listening to you! What right do you have to come in here
        and dictate how to play this role?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;You are portraying me.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;This is just a character, Oiwa, and unfortunately for you they
        aren&#8217;t interested in creating a pseudo-documentary of what
        happened in Yotsuya Ward three hundred years ago, even if such a thing
        were possible.&#8221; Suiko snapped, &#8220;I understand that your story
        is all you have left, but you can&#8217;t honestly believe you have any
        ownership over it now. None of us have any say in how we&#8217;ve been
        depicted. Look at what happened to my friend, the fox, look at how those
        like her have been demonized for centuries. She never had any say when
        someone would throw her out of her village simply because they had their
        own ideas about what a fox was. She only survived by hiding who she was
        for most of her lives.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Your friend still had the chance to be whoever she wanted to be,
        even when others tried to dictate her story for her.&#8221; Oiwa&#8217;s
        voice rose with her agitation, pounding off the trailer walls like a
        churning sea, &#8220;She chose to go along with the story written for
        her and therefore suffered the consequences.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Suiko stood up abruptly, squaring off with the ghost.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;You and I both know it&#8217;s more complicated than that.&#8221;
        She hissed, &#8220;You have no idea what those like her, like me, have
        gone through.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Forgive me if I feel little sympathy for you long-lived beings.
        If you do not enjoy the life you live, you are able to begin anew. If
        you do not like the body you have, you create something anew. If you end
        up loving someone who does not love you in return, you can find love
        anew. On and on you can begin again unless you are foolish enough to get
        yourself killed. How many lives have you lived until you became Morinaka
        Suiko, star of the stage and screen? Hundreds? And yet you criticize me
        for wishing for some control over the one story of my life that has
        circulated centuries after I died.&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        The ghost fixed its single watery eye at her, the rush of rage that
        swirled to its milky surface dissolving just as quickly back into an
        impenetrable black.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;I admit, though, I had imagined a tanuki, of all creatures, would
        be able to perfect this role by now.&#8221; Oiwa said snidely. Despite
        herself, Suiko bristled at those words.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;You say you are embodied, yes, but are you not also a being that
        knows what it is to be unbodied, even for just a moment? I have seen
        your kind transform, it is not an instant switch from one state to
        another, but a gradual change. What happens to your body when you are
        moving between forms?&#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Her words stopped Suiko, mouth already open and ready for a retort. She
        had never really considered what happened when her body shifted and
        molded itself in the same way she never really considered how each
        breath went in and out of her body. Yes, there was always a conscious
        element to it, a choice involved. But once she made the choice and the
        action began, her body simply took over.
        <br />
        <br />
        She tried to picture it: her human body transforming itself back into
        the shape of a tanuki. First visualizing an outcome, then willing her
        body to bend itself, the transformation creeping along each element of
        her form, a cascade linking one part to another until each piece was
        touched by the one that came before, all holding echoes of the original
        but coaxed into a new shape.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;There would be some time, maybe less than a fraction of a second,
        where I would be something else. Something in the middle but not
        necessarily exactly half and half. &#8221; She said thoughtfully,
        &#8220;I&#8217;ve never thought about it because the act of transforming
        always felt so natural to me, even when I was young. &#8221;
        <br />
        <br />
        Something of an approving smile glittered in Oiwa&#8217;s eye, her face
        gradually fading as she spoke.
        <br />
        <br />
        &#8220;Tap into that in-between,&#8221; She said, &#8220;Hold that
        moment where the potential is balanced between one thing and
        another—tanuki, human, life, death—and try to move your body
        again.&#8221;

        <br />
        <br />
        Unrestrained by the weight of atoms knit together, she moves through the
        trees that line the path through the forest. Under the cover of night
        she has already found the other others, her ghastly pale wretched torn
        face the last thing seen before the end. The ones who conspired, the
        ones who stole all that she was are now no more. All that remains is her
        husband.

        <br />
        <br />
        Tonight it is Tanabata and in the course of her wild flight she looks up
        into the night sky and she sees the lovers Orihime and Hikoboshi drawing
        close to one another, for one night crossing the vastness of the Milky
        Way to touch. On this night she too seeks the one separated from her,
        the one who flees. And she will also draw him close.
        <br />
        <br />
        She presses onwards.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a broad sweeping motion she takes in the scene rising up before her:
        the forest opening up into a glade ringed with bamboo, hundreds of
        colorful strips of paper tied to the trees fluttering in the wind as she
        stops, a weightless hovering above the grass. From somewhere behind the
        far wall of bamboo she hears the sound of rushing water.
        <br />
        <br />
        He is there at the opposite end of the glade tying up his own strip of
        paper. His back is to her and she feels a wide smile pull itself across
        her face savoring these few moments when he is so vulnerable and so
        oblivious as she had been before—
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>What is it you wish for</i>, <i>Iemon</i>?
        <br />
        <br />
        He straightens, as if he hears something moving in the trees.
        <br />
        <br />
        No longer restrained by the weight of being, no longer bound by the fear
        of noncoporeality, she lets herself expand outwards, engulfing the
        bamboo and the glade until finally the edges of her reach him.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Come</i>, <i>Iemon</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        She laughs when she sees him leap away from her touch, his hands
        scrabbling for something on his belt and she laughs harder when she sees
        the small knife he pulls out as she pulls him close so close and she
        holds them both tightly for what feels like an eternity before she
        releases him, the hilt of his own knife embedded in his chest catching
        the starlight as he falls back, tumbling into the river that snakes its
        way past the trees.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the river carries his body away, something catches her eye.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nestled among the bamboo and the dancing paper strips is a paper
        lantern, browned and yellowed with age. She looks closer and a face
        appears, the shadows of paper strips forming long black hair framing
        half-closed eyes, hint of nose, a slit of mouth formed by the slim
        backlit bamboo ribbing within.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before her eyes the slit slowly widens, tearing bit by bit, as the
        lantern smiles.
        <br />
