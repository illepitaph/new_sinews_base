Tell my mother I forgot 
I was and shall remain

I tithed into the member rolls of rival 
province-folk with service alley thirsts

orphanage supply drive prayer waffle breakfasts
tier one MVD customer service

the stay



Until waiting’s much the same but soft and mediated 
murder in pure darkness of a dome where they 
control the rain



Not to obfuscate my code I now 
could have magazines 
delivered is what I’m saying
back issues one could tell as
knife ads hewed slavishly to verdant landscape
laser grids and thus one could appreciate 
the magazine peoples’ savagely accelerating fate
in those homogenized fangs of their white smilers
though most of what my brain sticks on is language 
language language
until language one must leave it smells more shit than bleach
