<pre className={styles.right}>{`Your    office   air   was   cool   and

pants.`}</span>{`     I could hear the sonic,

things        randomly        and
mindlessly into a bag   and   I

zipper  grinding  each  other's
molars  as  you  zipped    one
bag up and began another.`}<span

suspected    that   you   were   preparing

defeated. `}</span><span
className={styles.alternateVoiceTwo}>{`            I began to prepare
myself, my   mind   mainly,   for   a
desolate   night,   my   first     night
in   Denver,   alone   without    you.
I     thought      how     quickly      it
escalated  —  one    moment   you
were    in    my    arms    and     the
next,   you   were   like       a young
soldier              who had just joined
the military,           sitting       on the
edge   of    the    bed,    waiting   to
say   his   farewell       and   I   was
that     pregnant     wife     with     a
three      month     fetus     in     my
womb, wondering           when you
would   return.`}</span>{`     The argument
appeared      surreal     as    a
       squid fight in the rain with
sharp steak knives.`}</pre>

<pre className={styles.right}>{`But your face and chest were blue
in  the  glowing   moon  and   your
tone softened  to the    tone  I love

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<pre className={styles.left}>{`The dark clouds of our bodies
took  a  sharp  turn.   Sunlight
began filtering through`}<span
className={styles.alternateVoiceOne}>{`    and we

embrace.`}</span></pre>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<pre className={styles.left}><span
className={styles.alternateVoiceOne}>{`In   the   afternoon`}</span>{`     we walked to
the      Corner     for     shrimp
bowls.`}<span
className={styles.alternateVoiceOne}>{`  We  waited  and      waited  for
our  food  to  arrive.  In the car ride  back
to Denver, `}</span>{` I read your  notes on
`}<i>Paradise Lost</i>{`.     Belial,    the
lusty  fallen  angel,  preferred
to exist than to not.`}<span

className={styles.alternateVoiceOne}>{`   The  most

className={styles.alternateVoiceTwo}>{`otherwise,    God   is   God.`}</span><span

className={styles.alternateVoiceOne}>{`You   drifted  us   out   of  the   mountain
