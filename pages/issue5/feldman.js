      We stopped in Jerusalem, my father and I, to see the sights, next to the Wailing Wall a clarinetist
      and his friend; a third man getting ready to sell yarmulkes was shaking them, curled tight as cowrie
      shells, out of a plastic sleeve.
      <br/><br/>
      “We have our capitalist Israeli family,” I said, “in Tel Aviv, and then we have our socialist Israeli
      family, in the south.”
      <br/><br/>
      “I think you’ll find the kibbutz is not that socialist,” my dad said. “They have people working
      temporarily who come from Southeast Asia. They definitely exploit labor. They are always looking
      for new products to sell.”
      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
      There had been amazement that in spite of my having been able, as a young Jewish American person, to
      avail myself of a perfectly good free trip, my dad was taking me on this vacation. “It’s a kind
      of private Birthright,” my “uncle” David said. He was beginning to call me, reacting to responses
      I made to his own comments, “perceptive” or “astonishingly perceptive.” He was, with his
      family, expert. They were bringing us to Masada, a mountain. There was a story to do with this
      mountain that made it a tourist attraction, but I had no data and, what’s more, nobody, none of
      the other passengers in that van, would tell me the legend in question—out of embarrassment,
      apparently.
      <br/><br/>
      “It’s not a very Jewish story,” my “cousin” Horam said, “and it’s not a very good Jewish story.”
      <br/><br/>
      We dismounted from the van to see an ibex eating trash. “They have done very well here,” Horam said.
      <br/><br/>
      “Ibexes?” I asked.
      <br/><br/>
      “Yes,” he said. “It’s a remarkable achievement, really. There is at this region a kind of zoo in
      which all animals mentioned in the Bible are grown.”
      <br/><br/>
      “I think you mean ‘bred,’” my “cousin” Ofek, who was still in high school, remarked.
      <br/><br/>
      “Of course,” Horam said. “The animals are bred.”
      <br/><br/>
      “Hang on,” my dad said. “I forgot about this, but I brought hats for everybody.”
      <br/><br/>
      “Hats!” David exclaimed.
      <br/><br/>
      I put my hair in a ponytail. Murals of Jewish stars in a lobby had been conceived without irony. I
      looked back to see my dad held up in a doorway, doing something challenging with a zipper of his backpack.
      <br/><br/>
      We had to take a chairlift. “My grandmother really believed,” David said, “that if she died and was
      buried in the Bronx, an underground tube would suck her over to Israel.” His hat was purple, with a tiger on it.
      <br/><br/>
      “I don't think my grandmother spoke English,” my dad said. His hat was green, with dragons.
      <br/><br/>
      I was using both hands to work on the spot where my hair came out of my own hat, fixing it up as I
      could; the hair tie needed to be on the outside of the hat band but was badly stuck.
      <br/><br/>
      “Ow!” Ofek said.
      <br/><br/>
      “Sorry Ofek,” I said. One of my elbows had struck him in the face. “Are you OK?”
      <br/><br/>
      “If I’d moved back,” David said, “it would’ve been a failure. That was plain from the start.”
      <br/><br/>
      We got down at the top. Ofek had a black eye. “If you look in this direction,” David said, taking
      a few steps away from us, “you can see a sliver of water. There where it shimmers. That’s the Red
      Sea, and that’s where we’re going.” An engineer, David was employed working at what my dad had
      described to me as a “salt factory.”
      <br/><br/>
      I went off with Horam, who was in medical school. He had served in the Israeli army as a medic. “What
      was that like?” I asked.
      <br/><br/>
      “There have actually been some interesting developments,” he said, “if you’d care to know about them.”
      <br/><br/>
      “Of course,” I said, and thought suddenly of stuff that had fallen into my sneaker, dry grass. “Hold
      on a second,” I said, and he offered me his elbow as I removed the sneaker and gave it a shake. Out
      fell a big, dead spider that was already dry.
      <br/><br/>
      “What a surprise,” I said.
      <br/><br/>
      “It happens,” Horam said. “They don’t have poison. There were rumors,” he went on, “of an elite
      corps of dolphins.” We were inspecting a set of cubbies that had long ago housed pigeons, messengers, and
      saw, turning back, David showing something to my dad, touching a model of fortifications that was hot, I
      thought, from sun. He pulled a hand back fast. Kids eating potato chips were crying.
      <br/><br/>
      “Among army people,” I asked, “or among suspicious civilians?”
      <br/><br/>
      “Among army people,” Horam said.
      <br/><br/>
      “What could the dolphins do?”
      <br/><br/>
      “You could train them Pavlov-style,” Horam said, “and get them to carry packages.”
      <br/><br/>
      “Could they spy?” I asked. “Like, could you put cameras on their heads?”
      <br/><br/>
      “No, these would be, uh”—as I let the record show, he audibly swallowed—“suicide dolphins.”
      <br/><br/>
      “What are you writing all this for?” he asked, just after that. He was leaning as if rakishly
      upon a guardrail, letting his forearms all but absorb it.
      <br/><br/>
      “I’m thinking of pitching something,” I said. “I have a friend I want to impress who put me
      up to it,” I added.
      <br/><br/>
      “Ah,” he said. “I thought it might have been something like that.”
      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
      As soon as I had the chance, I went for a walk with my dad. David’s way of speaking, its
      deliberateness, had struck me that whole day as interesting. “David speaks very deliberately,” I said.
      <br/><br/>
      “When we were kids,” my dad said, “David had a terrible stutter. And he worked, in fact, to overcome
      that stutter. The work was noticeable. It was as if he had on his own decided, one day when we were
      ten, that he just didn’t want to have it anymore. Of course his parents were glad. I think they were
      proud. They may have thrown a party. I was too young to understand what was going on. It was the change
      I noticed, because the stutter was normal, from my perspective. But I certainly noticed the work David
      put in. It was the kind of thing a grownup would’ve been likelier to do.”
      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
      All of us got into and finally out of the car heavily, limbs heavy from the heat. It was Shabbat, and
      the operation of machines in various greenhouses used by the kibbutzniks slowed to a stop. These
      greenhouses lay across the main road from a grove of buildings in which these people who were not our
      family lived. They had machines of yellow metal used to lift a single worker high as eighteen
      meters to pick dates. These were the machines that now lay still, folded in like sleeping roe
      deer on themselves.
      <br/><br/>
      “We had the unique experience of dedicating a Jewish cemetery,” David said. “We walked around this
      thing chanting songs for what felt like hours. What really moved me was that the rabbi said, afterward, ‘This
      is what separates a temporary settlement from a permanent settlement,’ and we were settlers, so I took that
      as a compliment.
      <br/><br/>
      “After you,” he added, holding open a door like a cloud.
      <br/><br/>
      We had seen a kind of field of fallen date palms that could not grow tall in sand but toppled over, as
      David explained. The sea, he’d said, was running out of salt.
      <br/><br/>
      “They had to bring in oil drilling equipment to get to this water,” David said, “water that hadn’t seen
      the light of day in millions of years. Some of it is geothermal. It comes out at a hundred degrees. We
      had a fish-growing operation there, but it collapsed because we grew too many fish for ourselves but
      we are too far from Eilat to ship them anyplace.”
      <br/><br/>
      Lining the greenhouse were gray-white tables bearing seedlings, hundreds of seedlings, plants too
      young to announce themselves as belonging to one species or another. My dad had taken off a hat, his
      sunglasses, and was using a bandana to clean his face. All through the greenhouse light was low and
      mottled by the spotty plastic of tarp walls.
      <br/><br/>
      Ofek dropped a set of keys and, apologizing, bent to pick them up.
      <br/><br/>
      A sound began deep in the greenhouse. It was irregular, a kind of pinging. We saw, far off, a cat, leaping
      between pieces of equipment.
      <br/><br/>
      My dad had stopped what he was doing and was looking in wonder. “What a stupid cat,” he said.
      <br/><br/>
      “It’s playing,” David said.
      <br/><br/>
      My dad went off to take a look.
      <br/><br/>
      The rest of us stepped outside to wait for him, David showing me the field of slim logs that was
      an impound lot for date palms. Behind it, visible to us, were mountains that the country shared
      with Jordan. In between were sheds I judged to be of tin or something. That was where the workers
      slept. We continued to be reached by the distant sound of pinging that, after my father joined
      us, as we walked leaving the car, went on.
      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
      My dad had a stomachache.
      <br/><br/>
      “I’m afraid it might have been the peppers,” David said. “We had them sprayed last week. Most people are
      able to take it. I would never forgive myself.”
      <br/><br/>
      My dad was, to rest up, napping, napping during the party, the Passover party. I had found a natural
      rise in the land from which I could, taking a break, regard as if objectively the scene of tables, plates
      textured by their specks of horseradish, and homemade instruments that had been put to use in the night’s
      course. There was music still, a DJ’s. In a ring a dozen dancers made their way around a pool. The desert
      all around was dark. The area of the pool was bright as if on fire. My “uncle” found me where I sat. “I
      know how it looks,” he said. “It’s not Paris, I’ll give you that,” he added. “It’s funny,” David went
      on, and I noticed that he had taken his hat into his hands and was worrying it as he looked with me, in
      the same direction, standing by the bench from which I had not risen: “When I was young, when I was your
      age and even a little older than you, nothing in the world could have made me believe, or accept the belief, that
      that circle of light in the middle of that vast expanse could have everything I’d need in life. But I think
      you’re smarter than I was at your age, and so maybe you can understand. You have a lot of energy.”
      <br/><br/>
      We watched quietly the scene below us as around us spread the realization, rising, becoming undeniable, that
      David expected me to respond by saying something. Laughter rose as well, accompanied by shouts and burbling
      until at once there was, amid much laughter, an enormous, world-ending splash as a body, with us
      watching, landed in the pool. A snaking wire trailed after, flashing even now. That was when the lights went out.
