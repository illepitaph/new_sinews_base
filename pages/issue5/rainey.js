      It’s early August and I’m waiting around for my life to start. Alone in my new room in Chicago, I
      watch the Errol Morris documentary about the portrait photographer Elsa Dorfman. On my chromebook
      computer, I watch her open up her flat files from the 60s through the 2000s. She handles her monster-sized
      polaroid film with ink diary captions on the bottom edge.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Elsa, charismatic and smiling, takes portraits of herself with her giant camera for her entire
      life. When the documentary came out in 2016, she was 80 years old. There she was: frizzy brown-gray
      hair and glasses, wearing a long skirt and old t-shirt, artist’s apron, and new balance shoes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When she complains about her husband Harvey, how he walks alone at night to the bodega, how he never
      gets her presents on Valentine’s Day, she has an affectionate smirk. “Very stylish,” she says about
      the reflective vest she had a friend sew onto Harvey’s coat, so he could cross the street with little
      risk of getting hit by a car.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Is photography the truth?” an interviewer asks her. She laughs: “Absolutely not!!” Errol Morris
      asks her whose idea it was to photograph Allen Ginsberg, one of her best friends, butt-naked, standing
      next to another portrait of himself on Polaroid film. “That was all him. He loved to be naked.” “So it
      wasn’t your idea at all?” “No. Of course not! A nice Jewish girl like me?” She cries when she looks at
      the photo. “I owe a lot of debt to Allen. The debt of friendship.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Elsa Dorfman joins a stereotype of brilliant women artists who no one cared about until they hit their
      late 70s. She’s peeling back the protective paper to look at her work. She knows she’s good. Maybe her
      lack of fame has to do with her lack of drama, an absence of provocative sadness. Colossal portraits of
      regular families smiling, some of their eyes squint in the flash, wearing 90s clothes. This work is
      about affection.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “I’m totally not interested in capturing their souls,” she says. She’s interested in the preservation of
      the surfaces of people. Elsa admits, her photos gain more meaning after the person in the photo has
      gotten sick or died.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I imagine that all the old Jewish people in my life are sewing reflective neon onto the fronts and backs of
      my clothes. As I cross the street, they are looking down on me.
      <br/>

      There are volumes and volumes of photo albums at my parents’ house. Film photography of our whole lives. My
      mom and dad never think of themselves as photographers. At a wedding shower years ago, my mom gave one piece
      of marriage advice: “Label your photos.” She said to my cousin’s girlfriend moving across the country: “Keep
      your photos on your carry-on, in case your luggage gets lost.” There’s a constant fear of losing the ones we
      love, the imagery of them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Everyone’s pictures are digital now, Mom. What does the phrase “label your photos” mean anymore? Maybe that’s
      what I have been trying to do, writing this story, wanting to keep us.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Once, my mom told me that we, my three sisters and I, will all have to fight over who gets the photo albums.  It
      never occurred to me that they wouldn’t always be stacked on the top shelf of the coat closet in my parents’
      little brown house. At the end of the cul-de-sac, across the street from the Taco Bell, and the highway to
      get to the city limits of St. Louis. Dark coats dangle below the shelf, the skirt of the memory.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My sister N called me on the phone and told me about my dad’s brain damage on the left side of his brain. It’s
      the Thursday before Labor Day weekend. My boyfriend D is driving me back to St. Louis, but he has some errands
      first. He parked his car in front of a hipster bakery. I’m in the passenger seat, waiting for him to drop
      something off at B’s, hazard lights on. Someone once said, find something calming to focus on. So I look at
      the boy inside the cafe behind the counter. My eyes water on a tiny chalkboard.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I look at myself in the side mirror of the white car. My face dyed pink, like I was dipped in blood, then
      dried. The animal moaning in the woods but you can’t see what happened to her body. The woman splits open, her
      flesh is raw and ancient and contains the calls from every family member she has ever had.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      D gets back in the car and apologizes for taking so long. We begin our long crawl out of Chicago rush-hour
      towards St. Louis. What is there to grasp onto, like a metal bar in a shower, a city of banisters? When I
      was walking down North last weekend, I thought I saw a stray lizard hand on the sidewalk. Pedestrians
      wander around, forever, historically, making shit up.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Wanna pick out some music to listen to?” D tries to soothe me. Across the divide of seats, he squeezes
      my hand so hard, he knows I’m numb. D changes lanes right as another car changes lanes, but he swerves
      out of the way. Nonchalant near-death. I look over at a billboard about Verizon phones. Pages of words
      line the city, flapping, air-drying. A city as two continuous pages of black lines. I wrap my arms in
      a hoop above my head in the car, sobbing. The drive back to my hometown, a tunnel of corn and brown and
      sometimes clouds. The sunset clouds blush with red tones.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Stopping for gas, we make sure it’s a gas station with a Subway. D and I are obsessed with Subway. My eyes
      are puffed out like I’m allergic to myself. I tell the sandwich artist I want olives and pickles. The
      employees are pleasant teenagers. In my blurred perception, they are having the time of their lives, working
      at Subway on a Thursday night in rural Illinois. D makes a joke with them about how their bread knives
      seem especially sharp tonight. Connection to strangers, small talk, coping mechanism.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I head to the bathroom to pee out all the Sprite. In there, a young mother and her toddler are standing by
      the sink, brushing their teeth. The mother takes a plastic bag of clothes out of the daughter’s disney
      backpack. She makes an effort to look up at me and smile. She says to her kid, “Say hi.” I smile back,
      trembling. Families are always in transition. My niece and nephew are two and five. A small split, a gap, a
      cutting and breaking of tissue, can take you away from me. I walk through the fluorescent glass store to
      the car. Falling deep into the seat, I turn into leather. There is not a worse day of my life that I know. D
      hands me a bag of gummy worms that are all different flavors of red.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The night before, I looked at his face and said, “When something bad happens to your family, does it make
      you think about the history of everything that has ever happened to your family?” I looked at his face and
      said, “My dream used to be that I wanted to be a writer. Now my dream is that I want to hang out with my Dad.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>*</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My mom points to my body. “Your dad picked out your name before you were born,” she says. “Did you know
      that? He heard it on the radio, an author’s name. He came home and said, I just heard the most beautiful
      name in the world.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I hold my dad’s left hand, the one that works. Our hands are both square and tan, short fingernails. “Your
      eyes are green like your dad’s, I never noticed that.” “They get even greener if I’ve been crying.” Like
      grass after it has rained. A memory of a green and brown river, square hands pull me out of the rushing
      water, dirty orange life vest up to my ears. My dad can say, “yes”, “no,” “ok,” “yeah,” “alright.” It’s
      weird because I’m 26 and I always thought that I was named after a Bob Dylan song. “____ was a gambling
      girl, gambled all around…” Maybe it was Johnny Cash: “____’s gone, one more round, ____’s gone.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Halfway under a white sheet and an old comforter, I wake up in my parents’ bedroom alone. The whole
      room feels brown and flat. Their bed, hard and centered like the plateau of the house.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A fuzzy curtain leaks tiny bits of blue light. Baby blue. At the hospital, I look at my mom’s notebook. She
      has names of all the doctors, words the doctors had said, the time when my dad was sent to the emergency
      room after he wouldn’t wake up from surgery. At the bottom of the page she wrote:  <span
      className={styles.grayShadowSpecial}>blur</span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Through my mom’s handwriting, I wrote. When I was a kid, my twin sister H and I would draw pictures and
      tell my mom what to say. My scribe. We had a series of stories about a rat family. Blobs of four gray
      rodents with scuttle legs, visiting an arcade, neat pen bubbling below. On the family photos, my mom
      writes: the date, the names of the people, where we were.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On all my baby pictures with my twin, my mom wrote our names or initials under our bodies to distinguish
      us. We were doubled, exactly alike in dark soft baby hair, big cheeks and big eyes. In early photographs
      of my life, it’s hard to place who I am without her writing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I’ve been sleeping in my mom’s bed with her for the past couple nights. I sleep on my dad’s side of the
      bed, on the memory foam pillow. She’s been having panic attacks, her heart beating like crazy. I don’t
      know if she wants to be touched. I sit next to her, practice the breathing exercise: in…….. and
      out…….... Mom, I’m here.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We woke up at 4:30am and got to the Intensive Care Unit around 5am. This is the first hospital. It’s a
      quieter one in the white-flight suburbs of St. Louis. My dad is still drowsy from the anti-seizure
      meds. I can’t remember why he’s on anti-seizure meds, since he didn’t have a seizure. Maybe they didn’t
      know that yet. He is recovering from the mistakes of doctors.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I watch the sunrise over the highway from the hospital window, but my dad is facing the other way, towards
      the gaudy pastel curtain that separates him. In the frame of the window, I locate the baby blue sky, a
      rippling of pink creams in. I see an American flag waving on a stick somewhere on a building. These are
      images I was trying to focus my reality on.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the hospital, it’s breakfast time. I feed my dad scrambled eggs dotted with pepper. A yellow
      fragment on the fork, I feed my dad a star. Through parted lips, he makes a small sound - “huh” - if you
      know my dad, you know this is a particle of him laughing. Our green eyes touch in the empty space. I hope
      my eyes are relaying my funny thought: <i>I’m feeding you like how you used to feed me</i>…
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A doctor walks towards my dad’s hospital bed. I point to my body. “I’m the daughter.” If a bedroom is
      a museum of two peoples’ lives, can I be the docent? Can I stand here in an all-black outfit and tell
      you the story, tell you the facts? If you get too close, I’ll say, “Please don’t touch.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Here in the gallery, you will see a side table stacked with white button-down shirts. Next, a rectangular
      mirror above the wooden dresser, with photographs stuck in the place between the frame and the glass.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My dad’s surgery was on August 29th, 2018, his 64th birthday. A standard rotator cuff procedure. He
      works-out at the Y multiple times a week, and tore some tendons all the way.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When he called me on the phone and told me that he had to get surgery, <i>and on his birthday</i>!,  I
      had just moved to Chicago. We both said, “What a bummer.” He would have to be in a sling for the
      next six weeks. I told him: What bad timing, right when I move. I wish I could be there to watch
      movies with you. One of the best moments of my summer was watching Putney Swope with my dad and
      eating pistachios, laughing our asses off. “This is an old cult movie I used to watch at the midnight
      showings with my best friend when we were in high school.” Labeled memory. I posted some old photos on
      instagram that morning: “Happy Birthday to my Dad”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My parents had all the photo albums out on the dining room table. They were trying to find pictures of my
      oldest sister N wearing her backpack going to kindergarten in the late 80s. Her son T, my nephew, their
      grandson, is starting kindergarten now. N texts us his picture, smiling in the front yard, turned so you
      can see his new purple backpack. Same dark hair and tan skin.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      No one’s at my parents’ house but me, doing laundry before I move to Chicago. As I flip through the photos, I
      hold my iPhone up to the clear plastic sleeves, trying not to catch the glare. I think: I’m going to need
      these. I want to discover my family before I existed. My older sisters are smiling and curly, in pastel pink
      sweatshirts and overalls, playing with leaves in the yard. With big 80s glasses and his shirt tucked into
      jeans, my dad is playing guitar on the patio. I start crying, the images overwhelm me. My parents gave us
      this childhood, a safe world of love. The kind of upbringing that I want to remember, even when I can’t.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Two hands together. The cake is brown. Let the babies blow out the candles for you. My mom’s bulging and
      structured handwriting transcribes the image: “Dennis’s Birthday ’87.” The letter ‘B’ for birthday looks
      like two pillows. Rest your head, Dad. Bits of Yiddish, <i>lay down keppie</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the hospital hours, I click on a PDF on my phone that I’m supposed to read for my first day of grad
      school. The class is called ‘Place, Space, and Landscape.’ The document is titled, ‘Maps of the Imagination: the
      Writer as Cartographer.’ There’s a medical drawing of a brain, checkered with lines. Compartmentalize. <i>Location
      of the organs</i>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and controls language. Half of the body doesn’t
      work. Half of the bedroom is empty. My mom speaks, translator. I point to my body. The nurse asks, “Is this
      your favorite daughter?” Lips part, “No.” We’re all laughing. My dad tries to explain himself, “Well…” I
      know, I know.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My sister calls me and tells me my dad stayed up all night saying, “it’s over it’s over it’s over it’s over it’s
      over it’s over it’s over it’s over” ~ baby blue baby blue baby blue baby blue baby blue
      <br/>

      <br/>
      I’m trying to do some research about what happened to my dad. The first websites that pop up on my search are
      sites for lawyers:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <i>There are many causes of brain injury, including motor vehicle accidents, falls, and being struck by an
      object. However, medical malpractice is another cause of brain injuries. With general anesthesia, patients
      are put to sleep during their surgeries. And although anesthesiologists often tell patients the side effects
      associated with the use of general anesthesia, the risks—such as brain damage and death—are often skipped over.</i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>*</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I find a dead black butterfly with iridescent blue tips outside the hospital entrance. I stick the bug in my
      notebook like a pressed flower. When I was between my niece and nephew’s ages, my mom’s dad died of mouth
      cancer, my grandpa M. He was a bug exterminator, and in retirement he worked at the insectarium at the St.
      Louis Zoo. He gave H and I hissing cockroaches as pets. When you are three years-old, your memories start
      to stick to your brain. My first memories of my whole life are of my mom in deep grief. I’m confused. I’m
      the size of a short plant, staring at her from the crack in her bedroom door to the brown room. I remember
      thinking that I wasn’t supposed to see her like that.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The hospital has a garden and lily pad pond that you can go to around the back. It’s dedicated to patients
      and their families. Right by the highway, this place is so isolated, so peaceful, drowning in quiet and bees
      buzzing. It makes me feel even more panicked. Artificial beauty is forced on my vision, but I’m not buying
      it. I can’t feel it. H, my mom, and I walk through the dangling summer flowers, saying nothing. Some little
      kids painted stepping stones about HOPE and LOVE. From afar, I watch my mom walk slowly towards a bench
      under a gazebo. She sits down. Her hands lift up. She is sobbing. “I thought he would be better by now.” All
      around us, the bugs of Midwest summer are grinding.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In <span className={styles.grayShadowSpecial}>Illness as Metaphor</span>, Susan Sontag begins: “Everyone who is
      born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer
      to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify
      ourselves as citizens of that other place.” I hold onto the word <i>spell</i> like a charm. The charm is
      clenched in my hand, like I’m a witch, and the charm cuts into my palm.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The male nurses are probably younger than me, docile white dudes in scrubs. They are saying to my dad in their
      sweet nurse voices, “You’re doing great, Dennis.”  Some older Jewish stranger in a polo comes in for two
      minutes and says, “You’re gonna walk out of here in no time, Dennis!” My mom smirks at all of us sisters
      as he walks out, taking great pleasure in the fact that we had no idea who the fuck he was. “That guy is
      your dad’s cousin. The dentist.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Once my dad is in rehab, my cousin J stops by for a short visit on his way home from work in the suburbs: “We
      need you, Uncle Dennis.” He is crying. In my family, people only cry when someone dies, when someone is
      born, when someone has a bar mitzvah, when someone gets married. In Jewish Sunday school, they teach us, this
      is your life cycle. These are the biggest events of your life.

      In the documentary, Elsa Dorfman holds up a Polaroid portrait of her parents, herself, and her young son
      Isaac with Legos against a red backdrop. Errol Morris asks her the significance of the color red, but she
      says there is none. “It was just there.”
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When my dad first got out of the rotator cuff procedure, the doctors could not explain what happened. The first
      week in the hospital, I remember so many doctors and neurologists coming into the room, shrugging. The
      anesthesiologist visited him in the ICU many times. Sucking up? We need to get some paperwork of his oxygen
      levels, to give to the lawyers. I remember someone saying that some papers were missing, but my mom says they
      were all there. How strange that I misunderstood the blank spaces.
