Lewd fortune does its cute attunement,
It says, Yes please I’ll have blank thanks
So much. So much land’s a fuck. It does
The permits, means the soil. Exchanges
Like a yawn. As a child I feared terribly
The stuck hinge I learned tetanus made
Of a jaw. I pictured a farmer in costume
Big loopy mouth hung well ajar because
I guess a farm’s where the rust and barb
Wire are. Have you lately gazed tenderly
Into an open cut?—was it yours?—best
For my purposes is if it is another’s cut.
Better too if the studied calm you look
With to project the tenderness was not
Meant to ease their hurt but to cement
The hurt as real? That your goal is not
Even to tend their need but to let your
Need to tend be known, not from some
Selfish impulse on its own but so their
Knowing provided for the cut one some
More steady and profound balm. Some
Are known to feed on other’s pain as a
Way to earn the data for a new genre of
Hurt.

I bet it’s dumb. Gore mauls time open,

Which is pretty dumb when you really
Think on it, since time’s the unit thru
Which wealth amasses, passive as a dad.
The better get
To do harm so
Gradually that only each who feels its
Flood (—in their blood, or guts, skin, or
The like—) trusts the pain they really
Feel, that each,
The theys, feel
All, individual. The most lauded calling
Of to-day is
That of harvesting from the body’s land
This embodied disembodied body’s pain.

      >{`I would begin demands to things, illegibly, before facing up to it, a total thrust of life
as sensible, a front for warding off. The screw that turns time’s thumb is sheared off.
And I’m fiddling with the lucite’s lock, on a hinge, a deictic If
that listens for the dimness of a proof’s blood folded up in the crux of a limb.
They’ve given me this sweatshirt that my shoulders note the felt of, my back
taut and neck dropped in to accentuate the drape I’m told is for getting it on trend
with a family of eleven networked keyboards circa 1990 IBM
that the seven twigs plunked with dew still on and bent and singed just for this purpose say
is key to growing marketshare in a plurality of tosses.
The discourse: a treaty that a trick of light undoes. When I peer off toward what seems to be
its edge’s lip, I meet in me a whirl of faceslooking aside and smirking intermittently, a grimace I can weave
a smile from. But do I want to? It’s like, if it were my heart, or not that but a hot lung pulled from me, being
mindful to take off the sweatshirt first and only slip my head back thru it once the blood has crusted nice
enough, there may then be a way to. I could regain a fond adherence to the medium.
It’s not like I have used them much. There’s something tedious in the bulging cells and too-deep redness
of the tendrils running wildly about, like it was something made in haste
and with a frankly sloppy lack of tenderness with limit and yet
pridefully compelled to come in under cost and for it to be, consistent with its aims, done on schedule.
Some things must be faced head on. So I leaned that way. Beside, I haven’t got a real desire to disobey
and in fact I trust the objects flanking me earn a conciliation’s sigh I’d guess, being teal, having a real great
texture that I couldn’t even begin, at first, to imagine—the kindly one, the type of crick I like sharing winks
with, not of intention but a mindfulness the bends in rivers lack but lift from thin tributaries meant to let time
broaden them. In the stream I see jokes flitting up like trout for gnats but helplessly, sillily, getting that
getting it is all part of the lure. Understanding that it isn’t reachable, that’s
clear. But, too, it’s, well, maybe the of of texture will snag on it yet still. Is it truly so off to see that a texture—
even a soft one!—has no texture, which of course it can’t—but does—that this texture may impress upon this
first supple so-thin slice of air? One’s distance to it is an If unfixed, transcribed and mappable
as when one, forced into the barest tip of noticing, must adjust a hand’s presence to the form
of compensation. But between these rank periods of, generally minute, adjustments and of fixities it is
distance that limiting becomes all too knowable a limn for, even if it had not been tallied up as such just yet.

My finest hook has in it a relatively fixed amount of barbs and also at any given moment, number of admirers,
but if these properties don’t hover in the cognition den I let thoughts int0, they’re done. Not because I won’t
allow them, it’s just I bar from entrance the unknown. You get it. I could tell fast you liked my thumb’s
bend, but that’s just not enough, see. Who else may have been in
it, while attending to this so. That’s it. You see
the peril. It needs a contract with endlessness,
a idiot move, infinity, that can’t keep up, not ever.
My palms are both facing toward, on arms limp and dangling yet not without great care, the fingers all curled
slightly in as though gripping something limp and loosely, some hot weapon needing a worm’s carelessness
in order to preserve the static of its being lain as dormant, reacting inversely with its function to tear potential
in its waiting there where length is curled.
But there is no weapon my hands grip. Rather it’s a gesture’s metaphor. Well, an illustrative ideation, too, yes.
Now you can imagine not only the tilt of each my hands but the figure they imported to operate within to lure
their tilt in with just so, critical as I begin, in telling you, as I did, of the emblem that my totalised body did for
guiding all this that I’d rather not be doing. I’m stable again. I’m under a palm and lurid in my mind. And you
can and I hope will make visual the endpoint of the texture of the ripples sent thru 1 by 1 the thin slices of the
air that are so neatly piled as to feel and to jot down as so minor a result as that which is impressed—I can just
imagine it! so subtly, by the dint
of texture’s surfacing that 1 is 1, that one over there, that one I briefly saw far off over there, and my palm will
shade the that of what I saw, its dust upon your palm, that what it is is smiling there—
of’s fruit—, if plucked and absently and under what totalises this so, just being here.`}</pre>

Portage, being the gross of all marches.
The reverse military pageant detaches.
Security sees the cowed parties off to sea.
That sift over the waves to civilian death.


The light, being the water’s excrement:
Exile’s unction. Nowhere: agapē’s kiss;
A cool breeze. Bora act. Then, a wind’s
Marbled blue, and bone. No act. Zone.


Wordlessly the sea keeps the occupation,
Shores open, the prison gates stand agape.
Impregnable, the Word hold. Portation
Marches. Sufferings of movement are air.
