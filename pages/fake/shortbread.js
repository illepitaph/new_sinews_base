        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Hey, Granddad, I called, swinging the batwing doors addorsed, I’ll have
        one of yours—neat.
        <br />
        <br />
        My own back was turned against the outgoing gust: lager vapor, and the
        lingering tar of the nineties. The outside door of Olaf’s was hung out
        of plumb, and took practiced maneuvers to pull to—which you had to do,
        lest it spring back to smack against aluminum louvers on the shuttered
        front of the shoestore next door. So inside, and in so doing—the
        practiced maneuvers, I mean—I was always falling backward through the
        batwings. And that night was no exception.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even with the time it took to catch my fall, I caught Granddad’s scowl
        when I turned around.
        <br />
        <br />
        And to what: turned out, to new stars fixed in the glittering firmament,
        the heaven of bottles behind the bar. Granddad was cowled in glory,
        stuck up at the head of an incandescent choir of brighter angels. A
        constellation of startling colors: Aperol orange, Bombay sapphire and
        the brilliant blue of curaçao. I spotted Campari’s limpid crimson, the
        same red as broached the vermouth’s viridian throat: blazoned a plate
        charged with a tart, or else the roundel sun, set within the inner Oort
        cloud of an argent annulet, and rising on either side of its horizon—the
        label sable over all. Or just, let’s say, the red of impressed wax on
        Tanqueray. I was impressed, anyway. All these glowed within the warm
        well whiskey golds of Early Times and the Olds—Forester, Granddad,
        Overholt—and also, through thick and faceted glass, the pale algal green
        of gin, the colorless clearness of cereal vodkas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Granddad had been a couple of classes below me at Willard. I didn’t
        remember his first name, but everyone knew his family: he was Olaf
        Aldinger’s kid, and born to the establishment. Although you wouldn’t
        know it from his aptitude. His attitude, maybe—Olaf never cared for me,
        either. When first the younger Aldinger started behind the bar, I’d fall
        through the doors, and call, Well whiskey, neat—and he always wanted to
        know, Well, which. Whereas, if you can palm off the bottom of the bottom
        shelf to someone who doesn’t care, like I don’t, don’t you just. I would
        call out, <i>Well</i>, Granddad. So I call him Granddad—called him that.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hey, Merry, said Granddad—but still scowling—Merry Christmas, huh.
        <br />
        <br />
        He never talked much to me—nor looked at me, for that matter—and
        although his dark look was <i>about</i> me, he wasn’t looking at me now.
        His eyes were fixed on a twist of terrycloth mop he was wringing out,
        which was wound in a seething ring around his fist, and on the soap suds
        that ran in runnels past his wrist. On the other hand, I was the only
        one there. I was the only one staring over the bar at his battery of new
        bottles, like so many antique ornaments: baubles and Victorian tumblers,
        strawberry bulbs, bubble lights. And all perfused with gold in luminous
        filaments, in wires and molten lances. Gold shot through Crown Royal’s
        diamond quilt, and gold hobnail in the cob of Nixta corn liquor, gold
        hoop nails banding the Peerless glass barrel. Gold the peerless shooting
        stars that all these bottles threw back on the bar, with the flash and
        glint of tinsel. I glanced at Granddad.
        <br />
        <br />
        It <i>is</i> pretty cool for August, I said, but I can’t afford to drink
        at Christmas, so—
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s <i>very</i> cool, said Granddad, <i>very</i> cool of them—it’s all
        a gift.
        <br />
        <br />
        Oh, um—<i>them</i>, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Granddad gave an exasperated sigh. He jerked his thumb to indicate far
        down the bar, and—with the white rag flapping by flexions of his whiter
        knuckles—he said, The Cookie Company. Kind of disgusted with me, like I
        should know.
        <br />
        <br />
        And there <i>was</i> someone else there.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, all that past winter, I had gone around town in this colorblock
        toque—either Aldinger would have called it a shipple—which my mother had
        dyed and knit. Whereas now, by August, she had just died.
        <br />
        <br />
        The hat had been a Christmas gift. A watch cap, my mother had said,
        because I’m watching out for you. Or, if she had caught me coming in
        late from Olaf’s Outer Space—particularly, if I had fallen backward
        through her undeniably level, plumb, and square front door—Because I’m
        watching you. And then I would say—if saying was something I was
        doing—Oh, you mean a <i>stalking</i> cap. And she would say, Yes,{" "}
        <i>deer</i>—or, No shit, Sherlock. It was a whole routine, which said
        something about my drinking—which she didn’t want to have to say. Which
        I didn’t want to hear.
        <br />
        <br />
        The hat was knit of wool dyed in cochineal extract carmine—with an alum
        premordant, and warmed with cream of tartar—and was lined with a pale
        pink cotton cambric. She had colored the cloth in the yarn’s dyebath,
        but the depth of red didn’t take. She said I could learn from her
        mistakes. She said, Sometimes, madder is gladder. Probably, she’s why I
        am this way. Anyway, for Christmas at Olaf’s, I was wearing that—it was
        <i>very</i> cool for August.
        <br />
        <br />
        Far down the bar, that someone else—the Cookie Company, I understood, or
        its avatar—had just cocked back her head to drop a shock blue shot.
        Cocked farther back was her own—frankly, unreasonable—hat. Hers was a
        kettlebrim, and uncanny kin to my own in color: carmine in the deep
        concavity, and carnation pink where the edges curled up. Seasonable for
        summer—it was knit of paper raffia, in a knotted openwork stitch—but no
        more reasonable, for that. The upcurve in the brim was steep, and gave
        the lip to a libation bowl, with the shallow crown its omphalos—a
        resurgent dome in the caldera of all of it. Or just, there’s a mushroom,
        sarcoscypha coccinea—scarlet elf cup, I’d call it. And the Cookie
        Company, she was wearing <i>that</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        No shit, she exclaimed, cutting her eyes sidewise across the rim of her
        shot. Reversing the glass, she balanced it—at points of parallel
        tangency—upon the false pontil marks of two already taken. These were
        the founding stones of a transparent rampart, footed in rings and pools
        of blue drink on the bar. Kicking off from the round rung, the Company
        spun her seat to face me. Gesturing between us with one hand—and wiping
        her upper lip with the other—she specified, The hats. This, in answer to
        my unvoiced—but plainly, apparent—<i>Huh</i>, <i>what</i>. And she
        tipped hers.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Company was otherwise swimming in a fractal camouflage chamois, with
        overlong sleeves fairly frayed at the cuffs, and duffled shorts in a
        drab green gabardine or duck. These fell to half calf, covering the
        upper shaft of her buckskin boots through the scoop in the scallop. So,
        no, the hat didn’t go. Did mine, though.
        <br />
        <br />
        She said, Want a cookie.
        <br />
        <br />
        And suddenly, I did—so much.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Company brought forth a quart bag from somewhere under her shirt, of
        slightly shattered shortbread biscuits. Around the decorative stamping
        of its upper surface, an intact biscuit—ideal, but increate—displayed a
        dentillated cornice of four embattled edges, invected at a single pair
        of adjacent vertices. The underside was set in a fundament of black
        fudge. The Company upended the bag, and began sorting shards on the bar,
        puzzling pieces together into resemblance of this unrealized ideal.
        Shortly, she turned back to me, to display a complete cookie in her open
        palm. She jogged her hand, as she might under the heft of a halfdollar.
        <br />
        <br />
        Solemnly, she said, A veritable and paramount shortbread.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then she indicated the dentition, the pair of protruding corners—obround
        as fingertips, or frogseyes. And she did say, Eight teeth to a side—and
        two eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        I raised my eyebrows at that, but I took the veritable shortbread, when
        it was proffered by the Company. I put it in my mouth.
        <br />
        <br />
        I made them myself, she said, and winked.
        <br />
        <br />
        I stopped my jaw, crumbs of shortbread sanding my molars.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wait, I said, they’re not—
        <br />
        <br />
        She let my eyes widen a long moment, and laughed.
        <br />
        <br />
        No, no, it’s my job. I work at the Cookie Company—or worked, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        No, I said, you <i>are</i> the Cookie Company, and cocked my head toward
        behind the bar.
        <br />
        <br />
        She laughed again. The cookie was very good.
        <br />
        <br />
        How do you get that job, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pull up a seat, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        So I say to him, Look, Mac—
        <br />
        <br />
        Look, <i>Mac</i>, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her eyes went teary, at that, and she looked beyond me—maybe to
        Granddad, I thought.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the bartender, then.
        <br />
        <br />
        Is that short for Mackenzie, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        McIntosh, she said. Anyway, I say to him, Look, Mac—
        <br />
        <br />
        Wait, sorry—your name is Macintosh.
        <br />
        <br />
        No, not my name, she said. Mac, like McIntosh Red—
        <br />
        <br />
        The apple, I said. Why.
        <br />
        <br />
        The apple, she said, because I was the apple of her eye.
        <br />
        <br />
        The castle of glasses was growing before her—stacked taller, I thought,
        than we had been poured. She ordered up two more: well whiskey for me,
        and the blue thing for her. What did she call it—errlight, I think.
        Neutral spirits and curaçao, as far as I could tell—mostly curaçao, by
        the color. But mostly spirits, by the smell.
        <br />
        <br />
        She told me the rest of the story: August—
        <br />
        <br />
        Last August?
        <br />
        <br />
        Oh, no, she said, this is years—it’s a couple of years ago.
        <br />
        <br />
        And it’s August, and she meets Mac at the intersection of State Route 99
        and Egypt Road. She’s passing through, and she’s just waiting for
        another ride. And this man wanders out of the trees, and into the lee of
        the oneroom Egypt School of 1898. Within the shadows of pitch, and
        white, and pitlolly pine, he’s gathering ramp seeds—nevermind that under
        pines isn’t anywhere ramps should grow. He looks ridiculous, in a
        peagreen trench, and the red hat—<i>her</i> hat, the scarlet elf cap.
        But also, he looks a part of the landscape: his coat is the color of the
        late summer lawns, and the parching boughs of pine. And irregularly
        redded with flat barn and fence latex—an uneven coat of their own—the
        lap planks of the schoolhouse match his hat.
        <br />
        <br />
        He wanders out of the trees—out of the branches of the trees—the
        scorched lawns—the spotty red siding. He wanders out of the landscape,
        with his coat and his hat, and his good afternoon, and would she care
        for a cookie.
        <br />
        <br />
        And so she says to him, Look, Mac—
        <br />
        <br />
        Like the apple—
        <br />
        <br />
        If you’re gonna try to pick me up, you’re gonna need to have a truck.
        <br />
        <br />
        But Mac didn’t, wasn’t trying to pick her up—he said there was shortly a
        bus for that. Mac wanted to <i>hook</i> her up, and with a good job.
        These cookies, right. His family made these—they ran the factory. Mac
        told her that the bus that was coming was the company bus, bringing in
        the night shift. And could she smell that, in among the dung, and hay,
        and heat—the smell of cookies, brung in on the night breeze. And she
        could, so much—and it smelled good. And she got—and now, she could get{" "}
        <i>me</i>—the job.
        <br />
        <br />
        What kind of hours.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nights, of course, and the other workers—
        <br />
        <br />
        They’re nice, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        They’re nice, she said, they’re just like me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nice, I said, that’s nice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Company put more blue back, and spun her seat to turn one, two,
        three complete circuits. Her eyes were focused somewhere over my head
        all the while—she was spotting a point in space. That was how I used to
        look up at the stars, riding my bicycle in circles in the dark. It was
        how I looked at the bottles behind the bar. When her seat stopped
        spinning, the Company blew a stray black bang from her nose, and
        levelled her gaze. Her eyes were the acid blue of the errlight, and
        burning into mine.
        <br />
        <br />
        So you want the job, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Granddad snorted. They won’t stick with it, he said, and shook his head.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe Granddad was right. I had <i>six</i> years at Bowling Green, but
        nonconsecutive—two, and one, and then three—and which never did sum to
        any intact degree. Where, my mom used to say, is your will to get out of
        Willard.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Company looked up.
        <br />
        <br />
        They won’t, she said, repeating the words slowly. I didn’t know that was
        an option.
        <br />
        <br />
        I don’t know that it is, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her eyes swivelled back to me, and she smiled.
        <br />
        <br />
        You want the job, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        For a moment, I didn’t say anything, and Granddad said, <i>I</i> want
        the job.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shut up, Granddad, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sorry, she said, without shifting her gaze from mine, they’ve got right
        of first refusal. You want the job.
        <br />
        <br />
        Okay, sure, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        You want the job, she said again—now my want was drawn out in her
        wording, so that it had two syllables. She was showing me the backs of
        her hands, and pinching the air in her fingers, all mafioso.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sure, I said, yes.
        <br />
        <br />
        You want the job, she said. This third time, most of the words were
        polysyllabic, rung round with vowel daisy chains that should garland the
        page.
        <br />
        <br />
        I could see that she wanted me to shake her hand. I could see that she
        had rather long nails, thick and lead blue. The color of deadman’s
        fingers, when they’re heaving through the earth in the spring. Only
        these were probably sharp, too. But I did want the job, and I said, Yes.
        I said, I want the job, with all the extra syllables, and I gave her my
        hand, although she took it strange, and her nails were sharp, and
        pressed crescent moons into the inside of my wrist.
        <br />
        <br />
        She put back another shot, and then, I’d have sworn she palmed the
        glass—I mean shuffled it under her cuff, and up her sleeve—except that
        directly, I saw her balance it at the center of the enceinte, in pride
        of place. Her castle’s keep.
        <br />
        <br />
        Come on, she said, you can catch the bus that’s coming.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I said, I mean—tonight. And stammered, although somewhere in my
        head, cash hammers rang already from register drawers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sure, she said, tonight. I’ll walk you to the stop.
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, you know—I wanted the job. What could I do.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Granddad had gone around the corner, into the kitchen. He was muttering
        something about red hats and ringing bells—but I couldn’t hear clearly,
        and it didn’t register. When the Company got up to leave, I looked
        doubtfully at our crystal castle on the bar. But she just waved her
        hand.
        <br />
        <br />
        On me, she said, and I’ll pay when I come back. I’ve got—I’ll have
        plenty of time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside, the Company eased the door effortlessly into its frame. The
        only noise she made was the grind of one bootheel in the gravel border,
        barely off balance. After all those errlights. Old Granddad—I mean the
        whiskey—had me swishing from side to side, entirely off the path and in
        the gravel—and having stepped, I believe, on a paddle of the Aldingers’s
        prized eastern prickly pear. I sighed, and cast a guilty glance back
        into Olaf’s Outer Space. Granddad—I mean the Aldinger—had reappeared
        behind the bar. His arms were at his side, and there was an unreadable
        expression on his face: the fur trim of his father’s Santa Claus cap
        completely obscured his eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once, my mother and I attended the Aldinger Christmas party—an annual event, which
        we would never again. Granddad’s older sister must have invited everyone in our
        class, and also—I remember, because thence the presence of my mother—everyone’s plus
        one. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I was going through a medieval phase—and my mother, a daring early middle age—so our
        party dress was in heraldic particolor. My dress was an actual doublet—very
        oversize, in velour and velvet offcuts—which Mom had stitched to coordinate with
        the colorblock on her secondhand skirt set. Which was Westwood Gold Label, and way 
        too cool for Willard: Oh, Westwood, another parent at the party said, my mother-in-law
        has their tea set.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also apparently by Westwood was Mrs. Aldinger’s punch ladle. A valuable antique, her
        husband said, in ironstone transferware, and dating from the turn of the century. The
        bonewhite handle—a very curved and hammerheaded affair—was presently swanning through
        the slot in the Salvation Army kettle, which Olaf had expropriated for a punch bowl. My
        mother wondered whether that was becoming of the Worshipful Master, who turned, in
        turn, red as the kettle. Or red as his Santa Claus cap—Goddamned shipple, he
        said—which was rapidly slipping down over his forehead. The Aldingers haven’t got
        much of that, so he was all red toque, muttering that it was something he did for
        the kids.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a kid, I didn’t care about the kettle—come to that, I didn’t care about
        the other kids. As a kid, I cared about the punch, which—under the crackle
        of conversation—I lifted the lid to see. The hinges gave an untuneful
        complaint, a screech of disuse proper to the sally port, the postern gate. But 
        just then, Olaf was loudly expounding on ironstone, and its inventors the
        Masons—that was, the other Masons, namely Miles and Charles James. So no
        parent noticed—or none who cared.
        <br />
        <br />
        On a moat the color of cranberry glass—a cocktail of clear pop and inscrutable
        juices—our hosts had floated brilliant bergs of sherbet. There were rainbow
        floes, and also, those in the tuliptree tones of triple citrus: pollen
        yellow, pith green, and the orange of nectaries, or nectarines. Everywhere, the
        ice exuded an opalescent foam, billows and conflows that made their milky way
        over the red waters, and up the red concave of the cauldron wall. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I <i>had</i> already been given a glass—I had, already, an unmistakable sherbet
        moustache. But the first punch poured for me had been a slurry, only sparsely 
        strewn with the seed pearls of pink and saffron frost, the glassy beads of
        green corn snow. I wanted a rainbow berg—an intact and entire floe. And I had
        my empty cup, and no one’s attention. Since the ladle was a valuable antique, I 
        stood on tiptoe, and put my arm into the kettle up to my elbow.
         <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        My mother found me in the Aldinger’s yard, making a rigorous and very
        red angel in the snow. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Now she is total gules, she said, horribly tricked.
        <br />
        <br />
       Or intoned, really—and then collapsed beside me in the snow. Between
      streams of psychic tears as yet unfrozen, involuntary laughter crinkled my
       nose—and then the effort of recalling <i>Macbeth</i>, my forehead.
        <br />
        <br />
       Yet, I said, who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him. 
        <br />
        <br />
        She giggled, and punched my shoulder. 
        <br />
        <br />
        To have <i>had</i>, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even through my doublet, her skin was cold—the Westwood suit had
        shortsleeves. She set her shoulders in the snow, and turned her eyes
        to the northern sky. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Are we wishing on a star, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sure, I said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, which, she said.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Mrs. Aldinger’s little dipper, I said.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Ah, she said, and are we having black and deep desires?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I punched her shoulder. Her skin was <i>really</i> cold. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Come on, Mom, I said, let’s get you home. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sure, she said, and standing first, she hoisted me out of the snow. Then
        she crinkled her nose. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Honestly, what kind of fruit is that, she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>#</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        “Shinjuku 3-chome, in front of Isetan.”
        <br />
        <br />
        It was Ryo. Horace did not know he was in town.
        <br />
        <br />
        No further explanation, so Horace told Phoebe his boss was calling to
        meet him on a street corner in Shinjuku at ten o’clock on a weeknight.
        At least the kids were already put to bed.
        <br />
        <br />
        When he got there, by subway, Ryo was already on the corner, alone. The
        department store’s doors were closed, although its Gothic lamps were
        still on. The older man was wearing a scarf and overcoat. Instead of
        motioning Horace to follow him somewhere, he stood his ground. He
        explained they would wait here for a few more people to show up.
        <br />
        <br />
        A minute later, a tall and very pretty woman, wearing a leather jacket
        and boots, walked up to their spot on the corner. She had had her hair
        waved and was wearing it loose. Dark complexion. Looked maybe to be in
        her twenties. Ryo only introduced her by name, Misa. They seemed to
        regard each other coldly and kept their distance from each other while
        both of them smoked.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apparently Ryo was somewhat buzzed and slurred, “When the others get
        here and ask you who she is, just tell them she’s my cousin, from
        Nagoya.”
        <br />
        <br />
        No need for outright deception, Horace thought. Everyone would see right
        through it anyway, so maybe it was more of a case of politeness? Who
        knew about these things?
        <br />
        <br />
        Ryo placed a call on his cell. About five minutes later, three men
        arrived, one older, two younger. The older one, with metal glasses and a
        few strands of hair on top of his head, was Shimamura. He was already
        fairly blasted. Red in the face, stumbling over his steps. The younger
        men, in suits like him, had to hold him up. They were junior financial
        directors who reported to him. Horace had been told Shimamura was the
        only one who had a full picture, and for that matter, any concrete
        understanding, of the situation of the overseas branch. For that reason,
        he was the only one in the organization who had any real authority to
        decide on their standing. It was a vital relationship for Ryo. On the
        other hand, it was just one of several he juggled and, to some likely
        extent, played against one another.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shimamura, who seemed to recognize Horace in his daze, came right at
        him, ignoring Ryo and his guest, and almost fell on top of him.
        Long-limbed, built like a basketball player, he put all his weight onto
        Horace’s right shoulder. Then a stream of gibberish filled one ear,
        which Horace, despite his improving language, could only guess was
        Japanese.
        <br />
        <br />
        The group moved north. Nobody asked about Misa. Yasukuni-dori was lit
        up. The finance executive attached himself to Horace and kept on
        babbling.
        <br />
        <br />
        They crossed at the intersection with Meiji-dori. It was crowded with
        matsuri booths and pushcarts. Tucked half a block down Meiji-dori was
        the entrance to Hanazono Shrine, mobbed by people both trying to leave
        and enter under a massive gate of paper lanterns. Squads of taxis parked
        out front waited to cart off drunks.
        <br />
        <br />
        They made their way past the tightly arranged booths with men and women
        in yukata selling traditional crafts. Ryo told Horace he would explain
        later what they were. There were also ones featuring games like the
        goldfish one he had played in the summer. They moved to the cordoned
        food area and found a table that would seat all six of them. It was a
        cold night, so that meant oden. Shimamura ordered three bottles of saké.
        Horace tried making some conversation with Misa.
        <br />
        <br />
        “You’re from Nagoya?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You live in Tokyo now?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah. I just moved here, for school. My first year in school, though, I
        lived in Nagoya.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You took the train every day?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Once a week. It was a pain.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “How do you like Tokyo?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Compared to Nagoya?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “A lot better.”
        <br />
        <br />
        The oden and the saké warmed them up thoroughly. Then they all went off
        to see the freak show. It was the same show Horace had seen in the
        summer, culminating with the Snake Woman. Same woman. Horace had to
        admit the effect was largely lost the second time around. Ryo and the
        others seemed to feel the same way, as it was probably old hat to them.
        There was no expression or comment from any of them as they shuffled out
        of the tent.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shimamura took his team for another round of drinks, while Ryo pulled
        Horace and Misa aside. He led them down one of the wide aisles selling
        what appeared to be gaudily decorated bouquets or wreaths, wrapped in
        clear plastic. Ryo stared contemplatively at each booth’s offerings.
        Misa kept her head down, hands in pockets. On closer look, it seemed to
        Horace they were not wreaths but decorated rakes.
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact that was what they were. Kumade, or “bear claws,” for clawing,
        or raking, in money. Most of the people buying them were businessmen,
        like themselves. Every year you bought one for success. More than that,
        if your sales were going to grow at all that year, you bought one bigger
        than the year before. That was why they came in all sizes. If it was
        your first time, you started small, so you did not end up buying too big
        of one too soon and maxing out. Ryo had gotten one every year except
        last year, because he could not make it back to Japan in time. It was
        this, more than anything, to which he attributed the disastrous
        financial results they had just posted.
        <br />
        <br />
        That was why, Ryo explained, Horace was being recalled to the States.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once he settled on something he liked, Misa became a lot more animated,
        chatting and laughing with the vendor, using a completely different way
        of speaking and looking suddenly a lot more at ease. Probably a dialect
        she used with a fellow Nagoyite. The kumade was massive. Its pieces,
        which included rice stalks and an otafuku mask, were stapled and glued
        to a thick bamboo culm. It stood as tall as Horace’s shoulders. Ryo
        explained he was going to have the vendor deliver it to Horace’s office.
        From here, it was Horace’s task to figure out how to get it back to Los
        Angeles.
        <br />
        <br />
        “That’s your job now. It’s a very important one.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Horace could not think of a solution for the moment, except to buy an
        airplane seat for the thing.
        <br />
        <br />
        The four of them, including the vendor, stood in a circle in front of
        the booth, made a rapid chant, wishing for good business next year, and
        clapped in time between chants. They all bowed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just as all three of them turned around, Shimamura and his two cronies
        came shambling back up to them. Shimamura tripped over a rock and one of
        the junior directors reached out to grab him before he crashed to the
        ground.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ryo gave the junior director a look, as if to ask, “Is he all right?”
        The younger man returned the look and shook his head.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Here.” Ryo pointed at Horace’s back.
        <br />
        <br />
        They dragged the executive over. Horace slung him over his shoulders
        like a jacket. “Put him in a taxi. Gogami-san will tell the driver where
        to go. See you next time.” With that, he walked off with Misa, into the
        lights and noise of the festival.
        <br />
        <br />
        Horace dragged Shimamura to the gate, which was twice as mobbed as it
        had been when they arrived. Nobody gave them a second glance. They
        managed to hail a taxi, and he dropped Shimamura inside, who was still
        gone to the world. Horace adjusted the glasses on his face, but could
        not quite get them right. Gogami shouted some directions at the driver.
        The door shut of its own accord. Gogami gave a curt goodbye, leaving
        Horace alone in the night. It was too late to catch a train.

        Phoebe had been sick since new year’s day, but she seemed to get over
        her illness after they boarded the bullet train at Shinagawa. She
        stopped coughing as soon as they got past Mount Fuji. It was the first
        time any of them had ever seen it. It is little understood how hard it
        is to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji from central Tokyo if not spending a
        lot of time in the upper floors of skyscrapers. It probably should not
        have come as a surprise that she recovered instantly. Whatever had been
        plaguing her in Tokyo had not followed her out of it. While they were
        concerned when they headed back, she did not suffer a relapse. The
        spirit did not return.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in Tokyo, temple roofs were white with snow. Tokyo Tower was half
        obscured in freezing rain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Plum blossoms were starting to break. In Chinese aesthetics, they were
        the more prized flower over cherry blossoms, for blooming in the wastes
        of early spring. There was a stark beauty to them, in the courtyard, the
        parks, buds on branches reaching over compound walls. The best place to
        see them near their mansion was a public playground two blocks away. It
        was interesting to Horace for its bizarre displays explaining the
        prehistory of the district. There was even a lifesize diorama of a
        neolithic hut, with mannequins. The plum garden was in bloom, very
        precisely, as if by design. Each blossom the same proportion. After the
        rain, their sugary-sweet smell drifted out the park into the street.

        Last night.
        <br />
        <br />
        They had shipped off everything that could be shipped and moved out of
        their apartment.
        <br />
        <br />
        They had to stay in a hotel. The plan was to get brunch in the morning
        and head out from the station for Narita by noon.
        <br />
        <br />
        They opened a bottle of pink champagne. It seemed a very Tokyo drink,
        somehow. The kids were watching, and to some degree comprehending, a
        food show on TV.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was warm enough to stand out on the balcony. Earlier that day they
        had taken a stroll through the hotel gardens. Camellias were in bloom,
        and there was the very first hint of cherry buds.
        <br />
        <br />
        From the balcony, Tokyo stretched before them. Red warning beacons
        marked off the heights of that incomparable skyline. The moving lights
        of trains and planes. To their left were the towers of Shinjuku. Right
        in front of them, the core. Mori Tower. Tokyo Tower in orange hues. A
        dark sea in the middle that was the Imperial Palace. On their right, the
        Rainbow Bridge and the lights of Shiodome, Odaiba and, closer in,
        Shinagawa.
        <br />
        <br />
        Of all things, it was the ending of <i>Père Goriot</i> that came to him.
        Maybe it was the champagne. Rastignac standing on that hill in
        Père-Lachaise, looking over Paris. It occurred to him, he did not know
        what lay ahead, but probably he would be back before long. But that
        would be for meetings and presentations, as a business traveler. It
        would not be anything like this.
