And her native figure:

Hers was a loose unsettled gown that draped an isle from where she was taking
and fraught of news that will said fought the whole sad tired beast

It was in-stapling.
The grift gab older

She came to die. It was Saturday, and the trees had varied frills and throws
settled about their leaves.
An open space was cleared where one could make out
trays of mushy bread, half-eaten pomegranates, raisins, and the pelts of rabbits
who had mistaken a trap in the wood. On the side of one, drear to the lit-off
hamlet, a roach had hatched and was busying itself
with making a bed in the fur.

She raised to touch it.

Ouches went thorough to the knee, as often casts
roil to the padlock, a wrist in fashions certain felt
the graded clop, the armor, glee, and belts of random certainty
run down the arbor.

It was a spree.

The roof went off.

She had just ran in tired health and now that death
had spelled its knoll inside of her she need not know. How. But the gladded
man approached her.`}</pre>

in the position of the subtle dream, saw less instead

wreaking song havoc in the mid dawn phrase
proportioned not to karma’s wheel.
