                God in heaven, he’ll strangle me, no, he’ll lecture me, that’s
                worse: How can I trust you with anything important if you can’t
                even . . . I’ll blame the maid. Can’t blame the maid, he knows

                both modest and exotic, he said. And if not the fashion, pearls
                are always in fashion. That was on our twentieth, and I think it

                the mistress got out her pearl necklace, went to fasten it
                around her fat blob of a neck, and then it popped and then the
                pearls flying rolling scattering every which way, his first good
                gift to her in fragments. Shattered! He’ll find some kind of
                metaphor for fragments. Some analogy with shattered, scattered

                1853. The United States forced the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan
                to accept unfair trade terms by send­ ing warships to threaten
                Japan with cannon fire.
                <br />
                <br />
                1893. Mikimoto Kōkichi, under the guid- ance of marine
                biologists, forced an oyster to produce a pearl by surgically
                inserting an irritant (nucleus) into its soft tissues.
                <br />
                <br />
                1899. Mikimoto’s first boutique opened in Tokyo, introducing
                customers to his “invention,” cultured pearls.
                <br />
                <br />
                1907. “The favorites of fortune the world over in all ages have
                succumbed to the modest beauty of the pearl. Its ascendancy
                marks not alone the refinement of the individuals with whom it
                finds favor, but the high status of the nation where it is
                widely appreciated.” (Cattelle, <i>The Pearl</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1911. “Perhaps it would interest you to know more about this
                wonderful and precious jewel which could not only reflect the
                beauties of other gems, but also put power into the hand of the
                feeble wise man to save a poor girl from a life of misery.”
                (Mikimoto, <i>Japanese Culture Pearls</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                c. 1916. In the US Midwest and South, button manufacture from
                freshwater-mussel nacre, a multimillion-­ dollar industry, began
                its rapid decline, having decimated its mussel species of
                choice.
                <br />
                <br />
                1927. On a visit to US factories, Mikimoto found that mussels
                considered inferior for button production made ideal nuclei for
                cultured pearls. He shipped the mussels to Japan, ground their
                shells into fragments, and implanted the fragments in Akoya
                oysters.
                <br />
                <br />
                1930s. “Even as Mikimoto’s cultivation operations relocated
                pearl oysters to cages and his female workforce out of the water
                and into shellfish surgical wards, Pearl Island put shellfish
                ama divers on display in the flesh. It was a new captive
                environment not [only] for animals but [also] for people.”
                (Ericson, “Nature’s Helper”)
                <br />
                <br />
                1955. “Furthermore, American women were wearing more of his
                necklaces than any other women in the world.” (Eunson,{" "}

                You’re having a snack on a day like any other with your hinge
                snuggling down into the sediment, tasting waterborne morsels
                with your cilia through parted shells as the river flows through
                you within you around you as it flows on days like this
                throughout the season, when suddenly the world convulses in a
                groan, the water is convulsing with the growl of a great strain,
                the sediment itself is shuddering and writhing and what can you
                do you only have one foot, you sense the contourless presence of
                a huge thing, taste the metal in the water, and that taste is
                known to you and dreaded although you cannot name it, the huge
                thing penetrates the sediment with metal cilia hooked and
                clawed, the thing as long as a tree is tall is dragging
                thousands of crowfoot claws through the sediment, raking and
                ripping your neighborhood from the riverbed, one of your
                neighbors aborts all her growing babies in terror, a hook shoves
                itself between your shells and you resist, resist in the only
                way you know, clamp your shells together and wrestle with the
                hook, you are wrestling the hook and being torn out of the
                sediment, shooting through the water and flying through the air
                in ways that you would never have believed, never in your
                life—the hook rips out of you, a searing flash of pain, bits of
                your flesh tossed overboard as you are thrown down on the deck,
                so hard so dry where is the river the water the water, you hold
                your shells together with all your might, keep what moisture you
                have in you, hold on to the water, you are wounded, you’re in
                pain, you are thrown hither and thither, crashing into dry hard
                things and crazed with fear, you don’t even want to guess why
                you have fallen, why it’s getting hotter and hotter, you don’t
                understand that you are being cooked and it’s your insides
                sizzling, twenty interminable minutes it will take for you to
                die, and you will die with your shells open, the shells are all
                they want, the softness of you ripped out of you they will
                throw—toss your shell onto a heap of thousands, hundreds of
                thousands of shelled relatives’ and strangers’ hollow corpses,
                then more flying and somebody will cut your shell into
                fragments, press each fragment between sheets of iron to grind
                down its edges, grind away the final vestiges of your sharpness,
                but by then you will not know yourself, you will be shattered,
                you will be unrecognizable as having been a mussel having been a
                living animal—except to those who inspect the nacreous
                protobeads, nurdlish pollutants that they purchase by the ton.

                Japanese cultured pearls to the United States.

                2012. “Harvest by the button industry and, later, the cultured
                pearl industry is widely and correctly cited as a major threat
                to mussel populations. . . . Systematic habitat destruction
                overlaid onto a wide variety of other impacts resulted in the
                first mass extinction of North American freshwater mussels.”

                You say you want to marry me because you came on the ferry that
                brings all those thousands of people to Pearl Island, and so you
                are supporting me already. You say you watch from the island as
                the red-roofed boat takes me and other ama to the demonstration
                grounds. You stand among the visitors and watch us carry on
                “tradition.” You say I’m the loveliest pearl diver in Japan.
                <br />
                <br />
                What do you know of me? My legs? My bottom? My white skirt
                tumbling around my hips when I go down headfirst into the water?
                Half the time, I’m holding my breath on the ocean floor, ten
                meters below. The smile. I see. The smile. When I bring up an
                oyster. Just one oyster, so all of you can see it in my hand as
                I raise it high in triumph before dropping it in the bucket. We
                ama are the true pearls of Pearl Island, yes, I know. All those
                men from Tokyo and America, do you think they’re really
                interested in watching my great-auntie muck around with
                scalpels, sticking bits of imported mussel shell and bits of
                local oysters into oysters?
                <br />
                <br />
                You say that you and I already understand each other. But did
                you know I’m not really a pearl diver? This morning a lot of us
                went diving for seaweed. Soon it will be awabi season. And sea
                cucumbers. And you know these oysters are good to eat. You’ll
                say I think too much; but I do think, if you must harm an animal
                or something, it better be for food, not flashy ornaments. I’m a
                hunter. As we ama have been hunters for generations. Except at
                Pearl Island. Here, I don’t know what I am. If that oyster I
                raised high in triumph stood a chance of having a pearl, do you
                think they’d let us use it in demonstrations?
                <br />
                <br />
                My grandmother used to mother the oysters here. They really did
                live on the bottom then. It was up to ama to make sure they were
                healthy, not befouled by snails or algae. When they were old
                enough, my grandmother ferried them to deeper water. Then
                brought them ashore for their surgical operation. Nearly a
                minute underwater; she used to try for ten oysters per breath.
                Her mother hunted them in the wild and sold them alive to
                Mikimoto-san. He calls oysters “mothers” too, you know. But
                what’s growing in them isn’t life. And they aren’t mothered
                anymore. They hang in cages from the cultivation rafts, and
                Mikimoto-san has men to pull the cages out and lower them down.
                Those men couldn’t hold their breath for as long as a blink.
                They don’t even get their feet wet.
                <br />
                <br />
                What am I? Oh, bits and pieces. Fragments of history and
                emptiness. Those white costumes aren’t “traditional,” by the
                way. I can’t think of anything more impractical for diving. It’s
                for show. It’s what Westerners want to see, and it complements
                the pearls. As do I. I’m an ornament for ornaments. And if you
                want to marry an ama, you’d better get used to being spoken to
                and spoken back to. Scattered she may be, but this ornament
                supports herself.

                1911. “It may perhaps interest the reader that a large part of
                the submarine work, such as the transplanting of the oysters,
                spreading them out on the beds, taking them out of the sea or
                putting them back there is done by women divers [ama]. This is
                universal in the Ago Bay and in many other parts of Japan. There
                has been a belief from time immemorial that women can work
                better and longer under water than men, and the women divers of
                Ise are often mentioned in classic literature. Perhaps this
                curious condition of things may furnish the modern student of
                social science an excellent opportunity to investigate the
                effect of the transference of the wage-earning to the women.”
                (Mikimoto, <i>Japanese Culture Pearls</i>) <br />
                <br />
                1936. “A million and a half akoyagai pearl oyster shells can be
                piled far higher than a standing person. In late 1936, a man
                named Mikimoto Kōkichi walked in the shadow cast by one such
                mound. . . . In order to atone for this, Mikimoto explained, he
                had decided to hold a Buddhist memorial ceremony (kuyō) on his
                company’s island theme park, a landmass he called Pearl Island
                (Shinjugashima). Around thirty Pure Land (Jōdoshū) monks recited
                sutras in front of a massive altar that had been constructed
                over four frantic days. More than a hundred of the company’s
                wage-laboring female divers assembled nearby. Print reporters
                and a Paramount newsreel cameraman recorded the proceedings for
                dissemination inside and outside the Japanese empire.” (Ericson,
                “Nature’s Helper”)
                <br />
                <br />
                1968. “And this thinking, fed by the present, works with the
                ‘thought fragments’ it can wrest from the past and gather about
                itself. Like a pearl diver who descends to the bottom of the
                sea, not to excavate the bottom and bring it to light but to pry
                loose the rich and the strange, the pearls and the coral in the
                depths, and to carry them to the surface, this thinking delves
                into the depths of the past—but not in order to resuscitate it
                the way it was and to contribute to the renewal of extinct ages.
                What guides this thinking is the conviction that although the
                living is subject to the ruin of the time, the process of decay
                is at the same time a process of crystallization, that in the
                depth of the sea, into which sinks and is dissolved what once
                was alive, some things ‘suffer a sea-change’ and survive in new
                crystallized forms.” (Arendt, “Walter Benjamin,”{" "}
                <i>The New Yorker</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1990. “The exhibits and brochures on the museum island called
                Mikimoto Pearl Island located in Toba City make it clear that
                the ama always dived for various things and not just for the
                pearl oysters which Mikimoto Kōkichi would then buy up for his
                experiments in the creation of the cultured pearl. No tourist,
                foreign or Japanese, ever seems to take in this fact. Thus,
                since the perfection of the cultured pearl in 1893, the image of
                ama as pearl-divers has developed so forcefully that it is
                almost impossible to convince people that this is in fact
                false.” (Martinez, “Tourism and the Ama,”{" "}

                1905. A toxic algal bloom killed 80 percent of Mikimoto’s
                oysters despite efforts by hundreds of ama to evacuate them to
                safer waters.

                <br />
                1936. “To date I have killed 150 million pearl oysters. I began
                as a helper in an udon shop, but I have gained position and
                wealth. Holding this memorial has lifted a weight off my chest.
                I can now enter the Land of Ultimate Bliss without hesitation.
                But my goal is to live to the age of eighty-eight. I will kill
                500 million oysters by the time I die. At that time there will

                profit. . . .’ What captures our eyes, this beauty, is no more
                than an irritation to the shellfish itself. This is what makes
                the pearl. . . . Who can say if beautiful things are beautiful

                are beautiful?” (Shibusawa translated by Boyd, <i>Takaoka</i>’
