                  Elegance both modest and exotic, he said. And if not the

                1853. The United States forced the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan
                to accept unfair trade terms by send­ing warships to threaten
                Japan with cannon fire.
                <br />
                <br />
                1893. Mikimoto Kōkichi, under the guidance of marine biologists,
                forced an oyster to produce a pearl by surgically inserting an
                irritant (nucleus) into its soft tissues.
                <br />
                <br />
                1899. Mikimoto’s first boutique opened in Tokyo, introducing
                customers to his “invention,” cultured pearls.
                <br />
                <br />
                1907. “The favorites of fortune the world over in all ages have
                succumbed to the modest beauty of the pearl. Its ascendancy
                marks not alone the refinement of the individuals with whom it
                finds favor, but the high status of the nation where it is
                widely appreciated.” (Cattelle, <i>The Pearl</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1911. “Perhaps it would interest you to know more about this
                wonderful and precious jewel which could not only reflect the
                beauties of other gems, but also put power into the hand of the
                feeble wise man to save a poor girl from a life of misery.”
                (Mikimoto, <i>Japanese Culture Pearls</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                c. 1916. In the US Midwest and South, button manufacture from
                freshwater-mussel nacre, a multimillion-­dollar industry, began
                its rapid decline, having decimated its mussel species of
                choice.
                <br />
                <br />
                1927. On a visit to US factories, Mikimoto found that mussels
                considered inferior for button production made ideal nuclei for
                cultured pearls. He shipped the mussels to Japan, ground their
                shells into fragments, and implanted the fragments in Akoya
                oysters.
                <br />
                <br />
                1930s. “Even as Mikimoto’s cultivation operations relocated
                pearl oysters to cages and his female workforce out of the water
                and into shellfish surgical wards, Pearl Island put shellfish
                ama divers on display in the flesh. It was a new captive
                environment not [only] for animals but [also] for people.”
                (Ericson, “Nature’s Helper”)
                <br />
                <br />
                1955. “Furthermore, American women were wearing more of his
                necklaces than any other women in the world.” (Eunson,{" "}

                  with your cilia through parted shells as the river flows
                  through you within you around you as it flows on days like
                  this throughout the season, when suddenly the world convulses
                  in a groan, the water is convulsing with the growl of a great
                  strain, the sediment itself is shuddering and writhing and
                  what can you do you only have one foot, you sense the
                  contourless presence of a huge thing, taste the metal in the
                  water, and that taste is known to you and dreaded although you
                  cannot name it, the huge thing penetrates the sediment with

                  and flying through the air in ways that you would never have

                  searing flash of pain, bits of your flesh tossed overboard as
                  you are thrown down on the deck, so hard so dry where is the

                  die with your shells open, the shells are all they want, the
                  softness of you ripped out of you they will throw—toss your
                  shell onto a heap of thousands, hundreds of thousands of
                  shelled relatives’ and strangers’ hollow corpses, then more
                  flying and somebody will cut your shell into fragments, press
                  each fragment between sheets of iron to grind down its edges,
                  grind away the final vestiges of your sharpness, but by then

                [Japan’s] rapidly growing cultured pearl industry and remains
                the principal supplier today. Few people who own cultured pearls
                produced in the last 50 years are aware that their gems consist
                of only a thin veneer of exotic pearl oyster nacre and are
                composed primarily of freshwater mussel shell most likely from
                Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, or Tennessee.” (Haag,{" "}
                <i>North American Freshwater Mussels</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1954. J. R. Latendresse founded the Tennessee Shell Company to
                export freshwater-mussel nacre to the Japanese cultured-pearl
                industry.
                <br />
                <br />
                1961. Latendresse founded the American Pearl Company to import
                Japanese cultured pearls to the United States.
                <br />
                <br />
                2012. “Harvest by the button industry and, later, the cultured
                pearl industry is widely and correctly cited as a major threat
                to mussel populations. . . . Systematic habitat destruction
                overlaid onto a wide variety of other impacts resulted in the
                first mass extinction of North American freshwater mussels.”

                  You say you want to marry me because you came on the ferry
                  that brings all those thousands of people to Pearl Island, and
                  so you are supporting me already. You say you watch from the
                  island as the red-roofed boat takes me and other ama to the
                  demonstration grounds. You stand among the visitors and watch
                  us carry on “tradition.” You say I’m the loveliest pearl diver
                  in Japan.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  What do you know of me? My legs? My bottom? My white skirt
                  tumbling around my hips when I go down headfirst into the
                  water? Half the time, I’m holding my breath on the ocean
                  floor, ten meters below. The smile. I see. The smile. When I
                  bring up an oyster. Just one oyster, so all of you can see it
                  in my hand as I raise it high in triumph before dropping it in
                  the bucket. We ama are the true pearls of Pearl Island, yes, I
                  know. All those men from Tokyo and America, do you think
                  they’re really interested in watching my great-auntie muck
                  around with scalpels, sticking bits of imported mussel shell
                  and bits of local oysters into oysters?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  You say that you and I already understand each other. But did
                  you know I’m not really a pearl diver? This morning a lot of
                  us went diving for seaweed. Soon it will be awabi season. And
                  sea cucumbers. And you know these oysters are good to eat.
                  You’ll say I think too much; but I do think, if you must harm
                  an animal or something, it better be for food, not flashy
                  ornaments. I’m a hunter. As we ama have been hunters for
                  generations. Except at Pearl Island. Here, I don’t know what I
                  am. If that oyster I raised high in triumph stood a chance of
                  having a pearl, do you think they’d let us use it in
                  demonstrations?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My grandmother used to mother the oysters here. They really
                  did live on the bottom then. It was up to ama to make sure
                  they were healthy, not befouled by snails or algae. When they
                  were old enough, my grandmother ferried them to deeper water.
                  Then brought them ashore for their surgical operation. Nearly
                  a minute underwater; she used to try for ten oysters per
                  breath. Her mother hunted them in the wild and sold them alive
                  to Mikimoto-san. He calls oysters “mothers” too, you know. But
                  what’s growing in them isn’t life. And they aren’t mothered
                  anymore. They hang in cages from the cultivation rafts, and
                  Mikimoto-san has men to pull the cages out and lower them
                  down. Those men couldn’t hold their breath for as long as a
                  blink. They don’t even get their feet wet.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  What am I? Oh, bits and pieces. Fragments of history and
                  emptiness. Those white costumes aren’t “traditional,” by the
                  way. I can’t think of anything more impractical for diving.
                  It’s for show. It’s what Westerners want to see, and it
                  complements the pearls. As do I. I’m an ornament for
                  ornaments. And if you want to marry an ama, you’d better get
                  used to being spoken to and spoken back to. Scattered she may
                  be, but this ornament supports herself.

                1911. “It may perhaps interest the reader that a large part of
                the submarine work, such as the transplanting of the oysters,
                spreading them out on the beds, taking them out of the sea or
                putting them back there is done by women divers [ama]. This is
                universal in the Ago Bay and in many other parts of Japan. There
                has been a belief from time immemorial that women can work
                better and longer under water than men, and the women divers of
                Ise are often mentioned in classic literature. Perhaps this
                curious condition of things may furnish the modern student of
                social science an excellent opportunity to investigate the
                effect of the transference of the wage-earning to the women.”
                (Mikimoto, <i>Japanese Culture Pearls</i>) <br />
                <br />
                1936. “A million and a half akoyagai pearl oyster shells can be
                piled far higher than a standing person. In late 1936, a man
                named Mikimoto Kōkichi walked in the shadow cast by one such
                mound. . . . In order to atone for this, Mikimoto explained, he
                had decided to hold a Buddhist memorial ceremony (kuyō) on his
                company’s island theme park, a landmass he called Pearl Island
                (Shinjugashima). Around thirty Pure Land (Jōdoshū) monks recited
                sutras in front of a massive altar that had been constructed
                over four frantic days. More than a hundred of the company’s
                wage-laboring female divers assembled nearby. Print reporters
                and a Paramount newsreel cameraman recorded the proceedings for
                dissemination inside and outside the Japanese empire.” (Ericson,
                “Nature’s Helper”)
                <br />
                <br />
                1968. “And this thinking, fed by the present, works with the
                ‘thought fragments’ it can wrest from the past and gather about
                itself. Like a pearl diver who descends to the bottom of the
                sea, not to excavate the bottom and bring it to light but to pry
                loose the rich and the strange, the pearls and the coral in the
                depths, and to carry them to the surface, this thinking delves
                into the depths of the past—but not in order to resuscitate it
                the way it was and to contribute to the renewal of extinct ages.
                What guides this thinking is the conviction that although the
                living is subject to the ruin of the time, the process of decay
                is at the same time a process of crystallization, that in the
                depth of the sea, into which sinks and is dissolved what once
                was alive, some things ‘suffer a sea-change’ and survive in new
                crystallized forms.” (Arendt, “Walter Benjamin,”{" "}
                <i>The New Yorker</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1990. “The exhibits and brochures on the museum island called
                Mikimoto Pearl Island located in Toba City make it clear that
                the ama always dived for various things and not just for the
                pearl oysters which Mikimoto Kōkichi would then buy up for his
                experiments in the creation of the cultured pearl. No tourist,
                foreign or Japanese, ever seems to take in this fact. Thus,
                since the perfection of the cultured pearl in 1893, the image of
                ama as pearl-divers has developed so forcefully that it is
                almost impossible to convince people that this is in fact
                false.” (Martinez, “Tourism and the Ama,”{" "}

                1905. A toxic algal bloom killed 80 percent of Mikimoto’s

                <br />
                1936. “To date I have killed 150 million pearl oysters. I began
                as a helper in an udon shop, but I have gained position and
                wealth. Holding this memorial has lifted a weight off my chest.
                I can now enter the Land of Ultimate Bliss without hesitation.
                But my goal is to live to the age of eighty-eight. I will kill
                500 million oysters by the time I die. At that time there will

                company knowingly purchased and later exported shells harvested
                illegally from closed waters . . . [but] several witnesses,
                including shellers and buyers, died under mysterious
                circumstances.” (Haag, <i>North American Freshwater Mussels</i>)

                2012. Because “the Japanese pearl culture industry suffered
                serious damage from the occurrence of red tides in the early
                1990s and red coloration disease in the late ’90s . . .
                researchers used a domestic pearl oyster strain that is
                preserved by the Pearl Research Institute, Mikimoto Co., Ltd.,
                for the pearl oyster genome-sequencing project. The genome will
                provide the fundamental information for understanding the secret
                of brilliant Japanese pearls and for the conservation of the
                domestic strain.” (Okinawa Institute for Science and Technology,
