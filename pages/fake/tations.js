                God in heaven, he’ll strangle me, no, he’ll lecture me, that’s
                worse: How can I trust you with anything important if you can’t
                even . . . I’ll blame the maid. Can’t blame the maid, he knows
                she doesn’t touch my jewels. <i>There goes one under the</i>—
                <i>catch it</i>,<i> you stupid girl</i>! Why he told her not to
                touch. <i>Another one by the curtain</i>,{" "}
                <i>the other curtain</i>, <i>see it</i>? First good gift he ever
                gave me, first lecture too, his purity of affection, because,
                you see, pearls symbolize purity and affection. And heaven.
                Wealth and prestige of the nation. And maidenhood, God help us.
                The timelessness of pearls, he said. No, that was at our tenth
                anniversary when I wore . . . <i>Hang it</i>, <i>there</i>’
                <i>s one right here under my slipper</i>. Ten years before that,
                he already knew, he said. That’s why he gave me pearls. Elegance
                both modest and exotic, he said. And if not the fashion, pearls
                are always in fashion. That was on our twentieth, and I think it
                was a quote.<i> For heaven</i>’<i>s sake</i>,{" "}
                <i>how should I know how many</i>? And they’re all matched to
                perfection, he said, all exactly alike, and how’s that for a
                miracle of pure, wild nature. <i>Oh</i>, <i>Tilly</i>,{" "}
                <i>you know that bit about </i>“<i>let no man put asunder</i>”?{" "}
                <i>That</i>’<i>s what he said when he gave</i> . . .
                <i>and now look what I </i>. . . Oh, I’m terrible, horrible, how
                did I ever get so—oh, it doesn’t even look like a neck anymore,
                it looks like a, like a blob about to explode! I’ve let him
                down, it’s unforgivable, he hasn’t said a word. But he must’ve
                liked my neck, all those years ago, to give it such exquisite .
                . . Tilly’s laughing at me, I know it, she’ll tell everybody how
                the mistress got out her pearl necklace, went to fasten it
                around her fat blob of a neck, and then it popped and then the
                pearls flying rolling scattering every which way, his first good
                gift to her in fragments. Shattered! He’ll find some kind of
                metaphor for fragments. Some analogy with shattered, scattered
                pearls, and that look of his, oh I can’t bear it! <i>Tilly</i>,{" "}
                <i>I know what to do</i>! <i>Remember we heard about those</i>,{" "}
                <i>from China or</i>,<i>no</i>, <i>Japan</i>.

                1853. The United States forced the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan
                to accept unfair trade terms by send­ ing warships to threaten
                Japan with cannon fire.
                <br />
                <br />
                1893. Mikimoto Kōkichi, under the guid- ance of marine
                biologists, forced an oyster to produce a pearl by surgically
                inserting an irritant (nucleus) into its soft tissues.
                <br />
                <br />
                1899. Mikimoto’s first boutique opened in Tokyo, introducing
                customers to his “invention,” cultured pearls.
                <br />
                <br />
                1907. “The favorites of fortune the world over in all ages have
                succumbed to the modest beauty of the pearl. Its ascendancy
                marks not alone the refinement of the individuals with whom it
                finds favor, but the high status of the nation where it is
                widely appreciated.” (Cattelle, <i>The Pearl</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                1911. “Perhaps it would interest you to know more about this
                wonderful and precious jewel which could not only reflect the
                beauties of other gems, but also put power into the hand of the
                feeble wise man to save a poor girl from a life of misery.”
                (Mikimoto, <i>Japanese Culture Pearls</i>)
                <br />
                <br />
                c. 1916. In the US Midwest and South, button manufacture from
                freshwater-mussel nacre, a multimillion-­ dollar industry, began
                its rapid decline, having decimated its mussel species of
                choice.
                <br />
                <br />
                1927. On a visit to US factories, Mikimoto found that mussels
                considered inferior for button production made ideal nuclei for
                cultured pearls. He shipped the mussels to Japan, ground their
                shells into fragments, and implanted the fragments in Akoya
                oysters.
                <br />
                <br />
                1930s. “Even as Mikimoto’s cultivation operations relocated
                pearl oysters to cages and his female workforce out of the water
                and into shellfish surgical wards, Pearl Island put shellfish
                ama divers on display in the flesh. It was a new captive
                environment not [only] for animals but [also] for people.”
                (Ericson, “Nature’s Helper”)
                <br />
                <br />
                1955. “Furthermore, American women were wearing more of his
                necklaces than any other women in the world.” (Eunson,{" "}
