        Driving past the houses of dead Lexingtoners I paused the book and
        repeated the phrases:{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          <i>
            May I be free of danger, May I have mental happiness, May I have
            physical happiness, May I have ease of well-being.

        I name this performance, I call it{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          Swallowing White Buddhism While Driving.
        </span>{" "}
        Thought: possibly I’m ready to swallow White Buddhism. Possibly I’m
        ready. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To write.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I had convinced myself fairly strongly that I wouldn’t or couldn’t
        write about the beginning of the plague years because, topographically,
        rather than happening around me, it was happening <i>with</i> and{" "}
        <i>on</i> me. (They are still happening with me! These years) With us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We had been told that, due to a forced poverty of sexual activity,
        aspects of our personalities would emerge that had been kept dormant,
        lending a renewed aptitude for everyday social life. Learn crafts, the
        art of something, living perhaps. Going on Zoom dates. Seeing this as
        yet another axiom in line with self-care capital-extraction, I convinced
        myself, with regards to myself, that there was nothing left to learn.
        However,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This was what autonomy earned. Scrolling back and forth through my
        matches.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Walking in the Arnold Arboretum with C., then back to her house where I
        was promptly saluted and sent on my way, despite being promised a cup of
        green tea. Thinking it had gone well. Walking across Harvard’s
        campus—from the Radcliffe Quadrangle, through the square to Felipe’s, up
        Broadway—with L., with whom I was excited to meet again, though{" "}
        <i>not in the headspace</i> to continue, or make of our time a process.
        A process I didn&rsquo;t wish to renew. Walking, one morning, across Perry
        Park for iced coffee at Broadsheet with A. in the middle of the summer.
        An agreement we’d made immediately, to acknowledge each other’s
        turn-ons. She told me to take my time with it. With what, presumably.
        She chipped a nail on my belt.
        <br />
        <br />

        I’d refused to begin writing this, I told myself, because of time. Since
        this was happening <i>with</i> me, and seeing as I have (writing this)
        no indication of when it will end, the only conclusive point I am
        capable of imagining (having <i>at hand</i>, very literally) is that of
        my own life. The end of my life. The threshold of a time period is the
        point past which I can no longer be said to exist in it, except in the
        memory of those who have loved me, which is to say, those who have
        allowed my bones to be broken and buried.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        So that that won’t do any good. You can’t write out a suicide.

          Dear Suicide,
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Make yourself at home.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Sincerely,
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Riding it out.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Not wanting to be honest with myself about my stupidity—not lack of
        knowledge, but its limit, its <i>founding</i> limit. I hear 2.01 million
        worldwide and can’t attach such a number to human lives. Rather than
        investigate this, I forget the number until someone says it out loud
        again. I feel nothing in regards to loss of life within the expression
        of a number. Rather, I feel the emotion behind such a number I can’t
        comprehend. To quantify, in a way, is comparing two objects. Surplus
        value measured out in rice in a Tik Tok helped. 1.4 million Americans
        attempted suicide in 2020, I’m told by a graphic. I wasn’t one of them.
        You cannot count the desire. I feel nothing other than the hope of being
        one of them at a point in time where I will be able to look back. 48,
        334 suicided (in the US). 22,000 students enrolled at Harvard, across
        the three schools. Birth rate of 11.990 in the US. How many is that?
        Google wouldn’t tell me, or doesn’t know. The truth is it’s all of them.
        It’s all.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          May I have a model for loss
          <br />
          <br />
          May I have the diagrammatical strength of a number
          <br />
          <br />
          May I have it all
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        And it all, someday, will end. Which is to say, for an us. As it, I
        would be remiss to mention, has been ending—and may have as well already
        ended—for some, for those on the outer circle, what we call “bodies,”
        concealing the guilt of how we’d previously identified them.

        “You did this type of breathing,” she said, and exhaled, slowly, twice
        through her nose, “and so I thought you were asleep.” “I wasn’t
        asleep,” I said, “I was emotional.”
