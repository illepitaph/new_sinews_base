        Driving past the houses of dead Lexingtoners I paused the book and
        repeated the phrases:{" "}

          <i>
            May I be free of danger, May I have mental happiness, May I have

        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          Swallowing White Buddhism While Driving.

        Thought: possibly I’m ready to swallow White Buddhism. Possibly I’m
        ready. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To write.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I had convinced myself fairly strongly that I wouldn’t or couldn’t
        write about the beginning of the plague years because, topographically,
        rather than happening around me, it was happening <i>with</i> and{" "}
        <i>on</i> me. (They are still happening with me! These years) With us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We had been told that, due to a forced poverty of sexual activity,
        aspects of our personalities would emerge that had been kept dormant,
        lending a renewed aptitude for everyday social life. Learn crafts, the
        art of something, living perhaps. Going on Zoom dates. Seeing this as
        yet another axiom in line with self-care capital-extraction, I convinced
        myself, with regards to myself, that there was nothing left to learn.
        However,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This was what autonomy earned. Scrolling back and forth through my
        matches.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Walking in the Arnold Arboretum with C., then back to her house where I
        was promptly saluted and sent on my way, despite being promised a cup of
        green tea. Thinking it had gone well. Walking across Harvard’s
        campus—from the Radcliffe Quadrangle, through the square to Felipe’s, up
        Broadway—with L., with whom I was excited to meet again, though{" "}
        <i>not in the headspace</i> to continue, or make of our time a process.
        A process I didn&rsquo;t wish to renew. Walking, one morning, across
        Perry Park for iced coffee at Broadsheet with A. in the middle of the
        summer. An agreement we’d made immediately, to acknowledge each other’s
        turn-ons. She told me to take my time with it. With what, presumably.
        She chipped a nail on my belt.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I’d refused to begin writing this, I told myself, because of time. Since
        this was happening <i>with</i> me, and seeing as I have (writing this)
        no indication of when it will end, the only conclusive point I am
        capable of imagining (having <i>at hand</i>, very literally) is that of
        my own life. The end of my life. The threshold of a time period is the
        point past which I can no longer be said to exist in it, except in the
        memory of those who have loved me, which is to say, those who have
        allowed my bones to be broken and buried.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        So that that won’t do any good. You can’t write out a suicide.

        Not wanting to be honest with myself about my stupidity—not lack of
        knowledge, but its limit, its <i>founding</i> limit. I hear 2.01 million
        worldwide and can’t attach such a number to human lives. Rather than
        investigate this, I forget the number until someone says it out loud
        again. I feel nothing in regards to loss of life within the expression
        of a number. Rather, I feel the emotion behind such a number I can’t
        comprehend. To quantify, in a way, is comparing two objects. Surplus
        value measured out in rice in a Tik Tok helped. 1.4 million Americans
        attempted suicide in 2020, I’m told by a graphic. I wasn’t one of them.
        You cannot count the desire. I feel nothing other than the hope of being
        one of them at a point in time where I will be able to look back. 48,
        334 suicided (in the US). 22,000 students enrolled at Harvard, across
        the three schools. Birth rate of 11.990 in the US. How many is that?
        Google wouldn’t tell me, or doesn’t know. The truth is it’s all of them.
        It’s all.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          May I have a model for loss

        <br />

        And it all, someday, will end. Which is to say, for an us. As it, I
        would be remiss to mention, has been ending—and may have as well already
        ended—for some, for those on the outer circle, what we call “bodies,”
        concealing the guilt of how we’d previously identified them.
        <br />

        “You did this type of breathing,” she said, and exhaled, slowly, twice
        through her nose, “and so I thought you were asleep.” “I wasn’t asleep,”
        I said, “I was emotional.”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I tried hard to think about what a world in which 2.1 million
        people had died would look like but I couldn’t see anything. When they
        say “no alternative”{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>(w/r/t Capitalism)</span>, I think
        they mean no positive alternatives come to mind.

        Are we in the disaster? We are. A reality we don’t need to read about.
        We can’t even imagine how it could be worse than it is. We can’t even
        imagine how bad it truly is half the time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I set out to write my life as I was living it: like the ‘talking poem’
        or ‘tape for the turn of the year,’ but, as I told myself, I wouldn’t
        hold myself to a schedule. Whenever a writer says “schedule,” it means
        that they don’t have a job. Academic poetry isn’t a job. Keeping
        appointments isn’t a job. Running errands, even for family, isn’t a job.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To write one’s life off-schedule, so to speak, meant never talking about
        what was important to the world at any point in time, because talking
        about what is important feels too much like a job. And I already have
        two. To write one’s life off-schedule: it meant a sex life, my vocation.
        It meant not talking about the initial Quarantine, the Uprisings (all
        over the world), the Great Harmonic Disarticulation, the Great
        Concealment (and those who conceal), the virus, the so-called{" "}
        <i>election</i>, the so-called <i>Insurgency</i>, the collective desire
        to burn, the collective desire to break quarantine.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        But rather sex, kissing people during a pandemic, learning to be lovable
        again, walking, writing about walking, writing about{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          {" "}
          Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Henri Bergson, William James, Maurizio

        Part of it? These words have not scaled the levels of memory high
        enough—in my regard—to be considered poetic. This brings up troubling
        distance, once again, between revolution and aesthetics. What I hoped to
        show in my writings was the emergence in the <i>smaller</i> aspects of
        life of a new sensibility, ethical <i>and</i> aesthetic, endemic to
        time. Of a period.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Were I to add dates, I asked of my writing, would it correspond
        impartially to events in the life of the reader? As their eyes process
        the page data. <span className={styles.boldHeader}>1.17.21</span>. Like
        that.

        Today I mourned, more personally, my grandfather. I walked around
        Watertown with B. The froyo shop owner asked me to come back later
        for a sample of something dairy-free. “It’s the oldest food known 
        to man,” he said.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I feel like going against orders, but against whose command? God
        came back in focus in a very God way.

        performance <span className={styles.grayShadow}>grateful to be living

        to my living when all I do is threaten what is outside the status
        quo with obliteration. Image of a canyon, introduced. Image of
        a white guy shirtlessly sitting in state, in a state of calm, in
        a State of violence, to fend off the violence that doesn’t even
        look his direction. I know my love is pure. I know my love is 
        only so pure.

        Violence that he&rsquo;s known only in between those events in which 
        he&rsquo;s “let go.” When I pay attention to the love the State 
        offers me I’m held protected like a white couple’s child. Like
        a pooch in the back of a Land Rover. Like a cake in the back
        of a Rav 4. Like a vegan Christian Q-Shaman. I can be bad and
        pay for that being bad without having to prove that I’m 
        good. There&rsquo;s no such thing as it. Anyway.

        This love (N.&rsquo;s love) exhausts: not financially, in the sense
        of depleting the means of my purchasing power—although, at some
        point, after all this mileage, I&rsquo;ll need a new car. Exhausts
        creatively, or approaches that which I had thought of as the
        threshold of exhaustion and obliteration (what one finds past
        the threshold takes three forms, only one of them virtual: 1) more
        exhaustion, as in, the prolongation of a limit [the outbounding
        of a multiplicity]; 2) sleep [we all know what happens in 
        sleep, what comes during and after, a person-less 
        duration]; 3) catatonia as the model for death, which necessarily
        does not include dying, the actual act, the
        bye-bye, hush-hush). Pushes me to experiment, which is to
        say, pulls wool over my eyes, then milk over the wool, naked
        as a. Jaybird.
