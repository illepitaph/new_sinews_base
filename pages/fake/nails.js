        To write.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I had convinced myself fairly strongly that I wouldn’t or couldn’t
        write about the beginning of the plague years because, topographically,
        rather than happening around me, it was happening <i>with</i> and{" "}
        <i>on</i> me. (They are still happening with me! These years) With us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We had been told that, due to a forced poverty of sexual activity,
        aspects of our personalities would emerge that had been kept dormant,
        lending a renewed aptitude for everyday social life. Learn crafts, the
        art of something, living perhaps. Going on Zoom dates. Seeing this as
        yet another axiom in line with self-care capital-extraction, I convinced
        myself, with regards to myself, that there was nothing left to learn.
        However,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This was what autonomy earned. Scrolling back and forth through my
        matches.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Walking in the Arnold Arboretum with C., then back to her house where I
        was promptly saluted and sent on my way, despite being promised a cup of
        green tea. Thinking it had gone well. Walking across Harvard’s
        campus—from the Radcliffe Quadrangle, through the square to Felipe’s, up
        Broadway—with L., with whom I was excited to meet again, though{" "}
        <i>not in the headspace</i> to continue, or make of our time a process.
        A process I didn&rsquo;t wish to renew. Walking, one morning, across
        Perry Park for iced coffee at Broadsheet with A. in the middle of the
        summer. An agreement we’d made immediately, to acknowledge each other’s
        turn-ons. She told me to take my time with it. With what, presumably.
        She chipped a nail on my belt.
        <br />

        <br />
        I’d refused to begin writing this, I told myself, because of time. Since
        this was happening <i>with</i> me, and seeing as I have (writing this)
        no indication of when it will end, the only conclusive point I am
        capable of imagining (having <i>at hand</i>, very literally) is that of
        my own life. The end of my life. The threshold of a time period is the
        point past which I can no longer be said to exist in it, except in the
        memory of those who have loved me, which is to say, those who have
        allowed my bones to be broken and buried.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        So that that won’t do any good. You can’t write out a suicide.

        Not wanting to be honest with myself about my stupidity—not lack of
        knowledge, but its limit, its <i>founding</i> limit. I hear 2.01 million
        worldwide and can’t attach such a number to human lives. Rather than
        investigate this, I forget the number until someone says it out loud
        again. I feel nothing in regards to loss of life within the expression
        of a number. Rather, I feel the emotion behind such a number I can’t
        comprehend. To quantify, in a way, is comparing two objects. Surplus
        value measured out in rice in a Tik Tok helped. 1.4 million Americans
        attempted suicide in 2020, I’m told by a graphic. I wasn’t one of them.
        You cannot count the desire. I feel nothing other than the hope of being
        one of them at a point in time where I will be able to look back. 48,334 
        suicided (in the US). 22,000 students enrolled at Harvard, across
        the three schools. Birth rate of 11.990 in the US. How many is that?
        Google wouldn’t tell me, or doesn’t know. The truth is it’s all of them.
        It’s all.

        I would be remiss to mention, has been ending—and may have as well
        already ended—for some, for those on the outer circle, what we call
        “bodies,” concealing the guilt of how we’d previously identified them.

        “You did this type of breathing,” she said, and exhaled, slowly, twice
        through her nose, “and so I thought you were asleep.” “I wasn’t asleep,”
        I said, “I was emotional.”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I tried hard to think about what a world in which 2.1 million
        people had died would look like but I couldn’t see anything. When they
        say “no alternative”{" "}

        Are we in the disaster? We are. A reality we don’t need to read about.
        We can’t even imagine how it could be worse than it is. We can’t even

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I set out to write my life as I was living it: like the ‘talking poem’
        or ‘tape for the turn of the year,’ but, as I told myself, I wouldn’t
        hold myself to a schedule. Whenever a writer says “schedule,” it means
        that they don’t have a job. Academic poetry isn’t a job. Keeping
        appointments isn’t a job. Running errands, even for family, isn’t a job.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To write one’s life off-schedule, so to speak, meant never talking about
        what was important to the world at any point in time, because talking
        about what is important feels too much like a job. And I already have
        two. To write one’s life off-schedule: it meant a sex life, my vocation.
        It meant not talking about the initial Quarantine, the Uprisings (all
        over the world), the Great Harmonic Disarticulation, the Great
        Concealment (and those who conceal), the virus, the so-called{" "}
        <i>election</i>, the so-called <i>Insurgency</i>, the collective desire
        to burn, the collective desire to break quarantine.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        But rather sex, kissing people during a pandemic, learning to be lovable
        again, walking, writing about walking, writing about{" "}

        Part of it? These words have not scaled the levels of memory high
        enough—in my regard—to be considered poetic. This brings up troubling
        distance, once again, between revolution and aesthetics. What I hoped to
        show in my writings was the emergence in the <i>smaller</i> aspects of
        life of a new sensibility, ethical <i>and</i> aesthetic, endemic to
        time. Of a period.

        Were I to add dates, I asked of my writing, would it correspond
        impartially to events in the life of the reader? As their eyes process

        Today I mourned, more personally, my grandfather. I walked around
        Watertown with B. The froyo shop owner asked me to come back later for a
        sample of something dairy-free. “It’s the oldest food known to man,” he
        said.

        threaten what is outside the status quo with obliteration. Image of a
        canyon, introduced. Image of a white guy shirtlessly sitting in state,
        in a state of calm, in a State of violence, to fend off the violence
        that doesn’t even look his direction. I know my love is pure. I know my
        love is only so pure.

        Violence that he&rsquo;s known only in between those events in which

        me I’m held protected like a white couple’s child. Like a pooch in the
        back of a Land Rover. Like a cake in the back of a Rav 4. Like a vegan
        Christian Q-Shaman. I can be bad and pay for that being bad without
        having to prove that I’m good. There&rsquo;s no such thing as it.

        This love (N.&rsquo;s love) exhausts: not financially, in the sense of
        depleting the means of my purchasing power—although, at some point,
        after all this mileage, I&rsquo;ll need a new car. Exhausts creatively,
        or approaches that which I had thought of as the threshold of exhaustion
        and obliteration (what one finds past the threshold takes three forms,
        only one of them virtual: 1) more exhaustion, as in, the prolongation of
        a limit [the outbounding of a multiplicity]; 2) sleep [we all know what
        happens in sleep, what comes during and after, a person-less duration];
        3) catatonia as the model for death, which necessarily does not include
        dying, the actual act, the bye-bye, hush-hush). Pushes me to experiment,
        which is to say, pulls wool over my eyes, then milk over the wool, naked
        as a. Jaybird.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Walking had been a way to exhaust, or test a potential. I was replaying{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          <i>The Wild Hunt</i>
        </span>
        . What else could I do with my body to teach my body to learn? (Walking)
        meditation should not have a goal, which doesn&rsquo;t preclude any
        other incurred states of being an effectual standard. An expectation, I
        should say. Anticipation?

        Some cold hard facts of my being have repeatedly cropped up in my
        thinking, in those unusually clear hours of my commute, like:
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I can no longer aim down the sight of a rifle due to an astigmatism in
        my right eye.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        What implications do such claims pose to my life I am living?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        When I sit and place one hand to the other, crescents touching at their
        tips, it’s as if I’m being cleaned.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In the beginning, I tried but failed to grasp an impact of so many
        deaths. That is, I couldn’t produce a reaction from within myself
        adequate to the loss of life that I was enjoined, by Liberals and
        Leftists alike, to bear witness. And not just any kind of witness, but
        the witness of grief. Instead, my mind centered on precarity, on
        layoffs. My own and others I cared about.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I began, though not with the intention of drawing a connection, to
        read memoirs of AIDS.{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          <i>Close to the Knives</i>
        </span>
        ,{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>
          <i>Crazy For Vincent</i>
        </span>
        . The latter contains one of the most tender moments, in a posthumous
        archive of tenderness, involving a sage-like Foucault.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike us, those who suffered AIDS at its frontline only had the tally
        of their own ghostly abscesses to justify their grief. They reacted
        politically, what we can call molarly political, to the cessation of the
        political visibility of what we can call their molecular politics.

        (from PBS’s <i>Independent Lens</i>)—where the ACTUP members, as well as
        other activists and family members of the dead, surrounding the Capitol
        hoist one another up to toss the ashes of their lost onto the
        Presidential Lawn, the chorus of “shame,” the chorus of “change,” the

        I read more articles than ever before now, forced to work, and also
        somewhat relieved to work, behind plexiglass shims with an iPad and a
        clicker to count the people who wander in. Often unmasked. Often
        perturbed by the apparatuses of biopolitical management made visible.

        A library, unlike a University (in its current form), is a workplace.
        The University is still just a factory. A workplace is carpeted, run by
        part-time, non-benefited ‘overqualified’ gig-workers. The work-place,
        importantly, looks and sounds like a workplace.

        Sweet, White Buddhism: the day after my birthday. We’d driven out West
        (Western Mass) to, among other things, visit the Leverett Peace Pagoda.
        Snowmelt. A statue, not far from the entrance. Woman and Serpent.
        Cambodian Monastery means snakes galore. Though born a rural Missourian,
        not my cup of tea.

        Call this performance Not necessarily knowing what to expect, though
        certainly not expecting serpents, enlightenment, or either of the
        passions of the tribe of calamities: the feeling of having just profaned
        an ageless ritual, the feeling of having flubbed God’s instructions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Is it correct/respectful to have said <i>Woman</i> and Serpent?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        A tough layer of snow had covered mostly everything, except for some of
        the statues which, seeing them uncovered, I imagined either resonated
        enough internal heat or drew to their surfaces enough visual heat that
        ice couldn’t take hold. The kind of imaginative flight I’m permitted on
        vacation. New sights generate new physical logics.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        N. claimed to remember the path to the pagoda with the vocal assurance
        she uses in every claim, and so we parked and walked between what looked
        like hastily fashioned cottages presumably for worshippers?
        groundskeepers? I wasn’t sure how holy places worked. I wasn’t sure if
        this was a holy place or the simulation of one. The ice further
        alienated me.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The <i>way</i> to the pagoda led uphill, a boon to the non-traction my
        Doc Martin’s lent my mobility.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Uphill in a foot of snow. Boots digging in and slipping further with
        every. Snow really fucks with the so-thought unslippable surfaces of the
        world.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        There was the sense of seeing something we weren’t meant to see, as well
        as the sense—the steeple of the pagoda lit up in gold and sunset
        light—of seeing something ‘you don’t see every day.’
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        No one around but the presence of ritual, the space of ritual that lays
        out a path. The pagoda is circular, meant to invite one to walk a
        circumference in contemplation. And we did, through the snow. Every 45
        degrees there sat a golden Buddha on different stages of his journey.
        Who knew how to decipher it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Once around, I googled whether or not we’d done it right. We hadn’t.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        White Buddhism allows for a pastiche of religiosities to compete for the
        interpretant’s titling. Life, as most religions conclude, is inherently
        (and eternally) wrong. I tend to believe that if your arm moves in a
        direction your arm moves in a direction that it should. I tend to
        believe in Pragmatism as an anti-humanism, which is antithetical to
        religion but not, as I’m reminded, religious experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I remember first learning the word anathema in the metaphorical
        relationship of a poet between a father and son. Seemed about right. I
        remember learning the concept of sitting, or of meditating. Someone
        said, it’s like you’re balancing at the edge of the world. Whose world.
        A woman I desperately wanted to be my one and only love relayed to me a
        description of meditating from Ginsberg: like a thumb wiping the dirt
        off a mirror (the brain). Later in life, Deleuze would call the brain a
        screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Screen upon which-is is projected, not a screen door one passes through.
        Glass, as a child, acted a lot like speech: bisecting one from the
        inside, and from within. This was not a transcendental synthesis yet,
        but the breaking one off from a group of things. Like a statue.

        If meditation is a practice of courting multiplicity why does there
        remain a trope of withdrawal?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I chose, as always, the Whitmanesque immersion over the secluded,
        occluded denial of influence. Influence: abrasion, inculcation,
        implication and contagion; of it all. Even the early Desert Fathers
        discovered retributive care only by remaining open to harm.

        I&rsquo;ve been practicing the five minute rule. If a task takes less

        To the camp counselors (administrators of the United States government,

        <i> shipping container</i> manufacturer—and individuals to watch the
        detained—our <i>only</i> eyes, whose recorded data remains invisible to
        us) their duty is to the stewardship of these extra-legal beings who are
        nonetheless on their way to one of two ends: the extreme of so-defined
        extra-legal exclusion (death), or expulsion from the between-space of
        the camp.

        Suffering. Not much more, goes my contention, should ever be said about

        All the while, stepping back from their role as a witness. Where do I
        place this in the narrative of <i>my</i> life? Modern life, such as it’s
        mediated, can only see <i>deja vu</i>-vision. The immediate

        Justification of the writing-machine, by and through which I attempt to
        write my life as it is happening, comes from a desire to escape the
        dipolic impulse of autobiographers to either relinquish singularity in
        the form of a romantic universalizing by which the narrative of their
        life could have an <i>end</i>, or produce a stultifying but nonetheless
        en vogue archaeology of what one calls one’s trauma (which is not to
        deny the presence—the ever-presence—of traumatic symptoms acting like
        speed limit signs on the personological and its deterritorialization) in
        the service, as far as I can see it, of amending the dominant “story of
        history,” ultimately contributing to what will have become a{" "}
        <i>truer</i> or <i>neglected</i> archive. City of lost toys.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />I likewise hesitate to call this writing fragmentary, because I
        believe ‘to fragment’ has lost all potency in such a stage of
        compartmentalization of existential possibility. Paratactic, rather.
        That attests to the continual, renewable connection across a breakage,
        void-river. Paratactic, strobe-writing: void-<i>rover</i>.

        I didn’t want to write about the plague years as they were happening
        because, just a week ago, someone tweeted “I feel like we’re all just

        miss. Being in the presence of. There is a peace pagoda. Western
        Massachusetts, like a Christmas Store, always stuck in season. Gold
        light: “The Golden mountain is in California.”

        Feeling as if I’d stumbled upon a secret. What is the form of the
        secret, or is secret the form of the divine? The mystery and the
        ministry. I feared what I was looking at, in being a place of worship,
        was looking at me—or at least was
        <i>visible</i>, in a way like a portal between places of seeing, the
        world and the other world.

        Another pavilion, though boarded up. Technically a very large shed, like
        the one in which my father built us four particle-board rooms to sleep
        in during the summer-fall-winter of 1999, while we were building “the
        house.” To the previous pavilion, there’d been steps within which we
        could add out tread, but to this other—with its thin boarded walls and
        cellophane windows—no artifact of past explorers existed. Maybe the
        trail picked up elsewhere, beyond the structure. Possibly snow covered.
        Looked like a construction site. Wondered what they were building. We
        entered a doorframe and shuddered at the sight of a sleeping Buddha in
        orange, made of plaster? Enormous. At least 15” high, 50” long.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Is this the pagoda?”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Absolutely not. This…”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Is something else.”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        How do you get to the top of this hill?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Through the trees, the golden top of the pagoda shone like a thumb just
        taken out of a mouth, glistening.
        <br />
        <br />

        A month later, transcribing all of this, I’m compelled to research the
        places we visited.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To my interest and embarrassment, the place we’d visited had been
        di-parate: a kind of Buddhist amusement park? The Cambodian monastery{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Wat Kiryvongsa Bopharam</span>,
        where we’d seen the snake divinities, the heads in the snow, the
        sleeping Buddha; and the Nipponzan-Myōhōji Peace Pagoda, built by the
        eponymous Japanese Buddhist Order.{" "}
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Nichidatsu Fuji</span>, who founded
        the order, I’ve found in my reading, was so deeply affected by the
        bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and dedicated the remainder of his
        life to building these structures across the globe.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.grayShadow}>Wat Kiryvongsa Bopharam</span> had
        been established after Nipponzan-Myōhōji, who were invited to Western
        Massachusetts at the latter’s request. The Peace Pagoda won approval of
        the town of Leverett in 1984, and very immediately construction began,
        aided by local Catholic nuns. Should I change the essay or just tack on
        a correction at the end, I text N., caught up as my accomplice, who
        deemed our ignorance. N. texts: “The whitest Buddhism of all?”
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className={styles.sectionBreakSymbol}>~</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        All of this.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        All of this matters, though it doesn’t necessarily strategically{" "}
        <i>mean</i>. Though it may someday, or already may for someone, whose
        voice has never been given.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        What can the monastery <i>be</i> in America but a mirror of defeat? A
        bare architecture gesturing to nothing substantially timeless, though it
        purports to have access to that. To whom does it give this access other
        than a people whose trace is already in the process of being defiled?
        Can one sit here, can one sit for an hour here.

          Hours before, we’d been on top of the covers in the Allen House Inn
          (the William Morris Room) fearing we’d sullied the doilied coverlet
          with our fluids. We’d been mistaken as two on a honeymoon, so we
          followed suit. Pained — like wet leaves blown onto a tree — conjoined,
          sharing a breathing. Whatever one of us bent over the other. Episodes
          of Jeopardy in between. The ‘leaden donkey.’ The ‘load.’
