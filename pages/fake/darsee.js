The proceedings were composed in the company of contracted workers under oath.

The consequence of violating our NDA is 5000 EUR, which is to be paid to the victim, which is the company.

These questions may be exported to a PDF and emailed to the appropriate network for observation.

In the hands of a lowly laborer, this process is time-tracked and will be subsequently deleted from the database.

The research will be photographed, lit, delivered. The research will not be given blind approval.

The research will be tried, tested, wobbled, fit, resized, teased, romanticised, willfully, and negotiated.

Limits will be set. All litmus tests will be litigated.

This is a controlled environment.

A severed worker is therefore required to deny all prior affiliation with the company.

A single monitor pours its artificial light into the open mouth of a typist, who chews
gum as they are producing text. The text is generated using a thrusting motion by which
a series of predetermined words are carefully arranged into different positions. The
typist is turning them over and pushing them around, against the page, holding them
there and waiting sometimes; sometimes rotating them and applying more or less force,
in order to coax the most desired action from the consumer. It is this singular text,
written over and over again, that teases the depth of a single original idea without ever
brushing against it. It is a text that you will read many, many times. It is a text that arrives
in your inbox, in your feed, in your window, in your throat, in your eyes, in your ears, in
your mind and even in your asshole. It is like an ouroboric parasite. It is choking itself
on the regurgitated belief in production. It is a text about the perfect leather bag.

As the typist chews their gum they generate copious amounts of saliva. At one point it
becomes so wet inside their mouth they must swallow or use it. Spit somewhere. They
spit on

the `}

spacious and voluminous they are transforming into stylish idioms, peaking with new shades of bliss and
