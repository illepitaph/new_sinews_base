this immaculate port o potty

by my idea of an uneventful morning
the idea of it being all over
can only remedy that by putting
construction paper blue tape
on the walls stepping back
reaping the walls
this happens when there’s no more
blood left you’ve used it all up
spit out everything 3/8 inch drill bit
take the man who helped me
home with me he’s in the squad now
a spree will suffice
a spree a spree come with me`}
