        She held a cup of coffee with both hands, as if to do so with one were
        an indecorous risk. She burrowed on the corner of a large camelback, as
        if to spread were an impingement on the comfort of future crowds. Her
        eyes ranged without focus, as if her mind were elsewhere so as not to
        occupy figurative space. She was collected, as only the grief-stricken
        are collected. I stared for a moment. “Beauty in distress is much the
        most affecting beauty.” I then looked at my watch.
        <br />
        <br />
        Naturally, she was devoted to a routine, of which I had caught an
        important slice. Every day at three, she would hold her coffee with both
        hands. I was not impatient to glance at the rest, no. For weeks I simply
        passed by on my way to Yáñez. Our times are so self-conscious that the
        idea of being watched has grown perverse; thus, all would-be observers
        assent to the inner censor at the sound of <i>creep</i>. Not I, however,
        for I know that observation is the greatest step toward conquest. I am
        spared the cues that would have me salivate. I seize. Oh, Crocale, I
        still remember the knot that melted into the loose sienna that covered
        your freckled shoulders—at distance under an agonizing sun and at
        proximity under a flickering light! So I learned the minuet of my Diana
        almost askance. It indicated the vacillation of one unacquainted with
        the ways of the world. Unacquainted and eager.
        <br />
        <br />
        I extended the scope of observation, and therefore obtained a firm
        support. She was a student at Yáñez, but she refused the typical lures
        that structure a student’s life. Her day was seemingly uneventful: she
        had breakfast alone at the cafeteria, she dined alone at the café, and
        she left alone by train. Seemingly, because the vacillation of which I
        spoke accompanied her at all times. The true outcasts among us take no
        heed of their brethren; they wilt equally in their self-made cells or
        out of them. A most exquisite beauty can approach, a most riveting event
        can develop—they will remain tainted by their inarticulate natures. But
        my Diana was attuned to the slightest pulse around her. A couple’s laugh
        would make her vibrate. She was neither the crumbling psyche that hopes
        in vain for a voice which will renew nor the statue ensorcelled by its
        own composure amid the gazing votaries. Yet as becomes proud youth, she
        would not acquiesce to the bumbling suitors. To open itself, a delicate
        spirit is in need of accident, for accident hints at fate. Indeed,
        Nephele, I relish at unaccountable hours the wide-eyed gratefulness with
        which you received your forgotten keys and the subsequent walk that
        reconciled us to the nightspasms, furors, reversions, and
        hyperventilation of this city.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yáñez had a reputation for the picaresque, so that my sitting next to
        Diana during breakfast was bound to assist in our union. We endured the
        public belligerence of infirm love, the wholesome slapstick of
        daydreams, the embittered élan of imminent senility, the spiritual
        corrosion of sinecures, and still exchanged nothing. I fought the urge
        to bloom ironic; I fought the urge to grin. Diana, in her novitiate,
        surely expected a pensive turn from the puppet thrust upon her by
        chance. I withstood, serene; she withheld, sedate. Then a gentle glance
        in my direction: spilled tea. Ah, yes, she shared only in the tame
        discomfiture. I was perplexed, and ceded somewhat to the abrupt felicity
        that overcame me, for in its natural surge it suffuses banality with
        charm, and banality is inevitable if one hungers to shape. I leave to
        the dilettanti the grand overture, which immediately chains them to a
        feeble lineage of compensation, where opulent balls, dazzling fireworks,
        and triumphant toasts lead axiomatically to spells of masturbation and
        demoralizing sleep. Is it not so, Hyale? Did I not sculpt perfervid
        turpitude from a block of pleasantries? From a courteous kiss,
        Mezzofantic cunnilingus. From a play with strands, the straining of a
        rope. From a reassuring hug, a synorgasmic reach-around. From blushing,
        gagging. From giggling, bawling. Were we not blessed by natural
        continuity? I bewail only the apportioned end.
        <br />
        <br />
        Diana, then. Soon after our meeting, I terminated my daily excursions
        into the cafeteria. Once a week we would have an amiable conversation.
        And again through a certain triviality of subject I managed to
        understand more about her life: a joke revealed the absence of the
        mother, a side-remark the improvidence of the household. Having gathered
        a fuller account of these misfortunes and a fuller trust, I saw her once
        every two weeks. Our interactions suddenly acquired an edge. Her scant
        syllables lost their drowsy glow; her leisurely bearing tensed into a
        working of gears. And now my leave was something of a climax. Among the
        many valuable subtleties seduction has accrued over the centuries, none
        has the ever-renewing power of selective indifference, for it exploits
        the crude predictions of sympathy. The reunion of souls that rises
        unobstructed is a universal wish, and as all universal wishes it is
        tepid in the common mind. Subvert it and see the turmoil of doubt’s
        birth. Yet doubt is infinitely delicate; it solidifies into despair
        rather quickly, and despair is barren. Doubt must be assuaged. Here, at
        last, is irony useful; its opaque festiveness upsets and placates the
        spirit. Thus my Diana softened her pride enough to ask for a less
        restricted encounter. I let her arrange the particulars. Now, there is a
        lot of talk about <i>confidence</i>. One finds in its proselytes the
        detestable literality of mind that has begotten the modern pickup
        artist. To equate confidence with the narrowness of a drill sergeant is
        to betray a tawdry mind. Surely among the myriad meek something can be
        gained so, but compulsive pleasure loses all adherents. Confidence works
        only as background; its colors are far too dour to sustain an attentive
        eye, and is not the ambivalent eye mercilessly attentive? Let your
        interest lead. In following, learn. As did I by the side of Rhanis, who
        suffused my gestures with a feigned tenderness that grew authentic and
        outlined my mask so that it lost its slickness. Yes, there is more gusto
        in the stick brandished as a sword than in the hollow replica!
        <br />
        <br />
        My candid Diana was fond of those restaurants that merge with the
        decaying architecture of the past. She immersed herself in visions
        manufactured for the poor and the foreign. But was I not immersed too in
        visions of my own? As flimsy, as uninspired? For I confess that her
        bodycon made light of any aloof disposition. Her figure, erstwhile
        hidden under garments derived from the farthingale, irradiated
        sensuality—preternatural because unforeseen. I grant, then, the
        supremacy of her method. “Even innocence itself has many a wile.” She
        now constructed long, complex, unpredictable sentences, in which I
        detected a similarly long, complex, unpredictable assemblage of values.
        Physically and intellectually I was being outmatched. An
        autobiographical extravaganza was improper: she had always shown a
        moderate interest in my past, which could be attributed to her aperiodic
        decorum. I essayed droll glosses, but every one of my improvisations was
        received with a raised eyebrow. While her words were polite, I could see
        that waves of uncontainable irony impelled her movements. There was need
        for rearrangement. It would have been foolish to comment upon her ways:
        this is the solution of the desperate, of the humbled, and it gains
        either commiseration or contempt. Worse still to withdraw into coldness,
        province of the sour. Therefore, I added a disarming sincerity to my
        questions, as if conceding that up until then I had been shouting from
        the other side of a barrier. It worked, of course. She probably believed
        this change tied some loose ends about me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am aware of the tone into which I’ve lapsed at this point. Thus with
        Ovid I reply: “How often it has happened that the man who begins by
        feigning love ends by falling in love in real earnest. Ah, my fair ones,
        look with indulgent eye on those that give themselves a lover’s airs;
        the love, now feigned, will soon be love indeed.” Not long after that
        first evening, the realization struck. A problem of the very highest
        order, for I was transgressing the pace that had ever assured
        attainment. Yet also a spur to yield upward. She that overruled I would
        oversway.
        <br />
        <br />
        There were no further invitations. We resumed our mornings at the
        cafeteria. Recency seemed to fail. She was determined to make of me the
        tritagonist of her tardigrade plotting. It would have been a simple
        matter: she merely had to overlap the images of my irresolution. It
        would have been a simple matter had I gone for compensation, but I never
        permit contrast to work against me. I catered to consistency, undeterred
        by the prospect of beginning anew. When there is a path set out, love
        quickens. Were we not, Psecas, a pairing of innumerous dawns? And did
        not I in each govern you in lust? Solisequious as you were, I marshaled
        the night, where desire sees best of all. But “when the goal is gained,
        we die.” A lesson is an echo is a sound.
        <br />
        <br />I could sense a growing feeling of command in her. Once again I
        confronted the Diana of the evening. Her autobiographical fragments were
        dangerously whole now. Dangerously, yes, for there is no strand of life
        that escapes my imagination. I weave with and secure. The woman who is
        momentarily restrained in motherhood then rebels edifies her progeny.
        More so, when the man withholds recognition. A drama of symbols, forever
        lodged in the inaccessible strata of the spectator’s psyche—heightened
        by the climax of dereliction. Oh, Diana! I sought the mother in you,
        tender and trapped, indrawn and ornery. I sought the father too, mulish
        and mum. I sought so that I played in counterpoint. Pair of
        hermaphrodites! All for release. In you as cathartic tribute, in me...
        likewise. I was, am, and will be nothing that interferes. I was, am, and
        will be for <i>you</i>. Not for them, the most vulgar fiction. Even if a
        crowd is lined after a lifetime, its every soul, to the artist, exists
        one-on-one.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yours, however, bifurcated. Much hid in the first mention of his name.
        You made sure that each syllable struck my ear with vehemence. Did I
        know him? I did, and I focused on my composure: memory served a
        slouching homunculus whose voice trickled like a laggard wad of cum.
        Diana was examining this stag with veiled oeilliades?
        <br />
        <br />
        Enraptured though I was, I could not possibly be prey to jealousy. This
        particular state requires something to instigate speculation, and the
        stag instigated only discomfort akin to that caused by nipple clamps. He
        lacked an abundance of ire, of lust, of play. That is, he lacked all
        three emotions which give rise to the phenomenological experience of
        love, for it is exclusively in abundance that one can be said to possess
        an emotion. Had he displayed the slightest competence, I would have
        attributed it to xenoglossia. It is owing to men of his temper that a
        girdle of Venus has ever loomed in the relations between the sexes. Now,
        injustice will be readily imputed to my characterization. I talk of a
        refinement of spirit and yet refuse to grant Diana grounds for her
        interest. Obfuscation. That is the sole reach of the unripe. Certainly,
        the stag, buried as he was in a more rarefied atmosphere, could manage
        the tricks of irrationalism and so assume the pose of an iconoclast. He
        whispered into Diana’s ears a scurrilous defiance of what I represented:
        I was a minister of stale arcana, who in his way preserved the line of
        Sprenger and Institoris; somewhat paradoxically, I also defiled the
        deluded aspirants and allowed no ascendance. I find myself more aligned
        with Angéle de la Barthe, to be sure. But the words had an effect, and
        the modest halo they provided would have to be dislimned. Although I did
        not have the drive of jealousy, I had the greater drive of calculation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The stag had been sly. Everything I had to gather from Diana’s hints.
        Once privy, however, I could dispose of him swiftly. The method would be
        jarring, but by then I knew Diana’s underlying leniency. Thus I intruded
        erratically upon their meetings. At first, he pouted and left in haste.
        He realized eventually that my presence was insidious; he felt he had to
        take a stand. His dimwitted approach was faux-Socratic. The “pointed”
        questions of early youth are invariably an embarrassment: they do not
        have the innocent charm of a morning or the weighty pathos of an
        evening; they have only the suffocating dullness of noon. I was,
        therefore, scathing. And alert to Diana’s reactions. While I grazed the
        boorishness of a Thrasymachus, I took care to retreat when nearing
        cruelty. Yet the stag grew obstreperous. His insolence, <i>its</i>{" "}
        insolence, finally alienated <i>la belle dame avec merci</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hasten to add that I was, and remain, immensely pleased with the
        performance. The debris of chivalric codes of conduct has never found a
        restorative bent within me. A call to invigorate the will is sovereign.
        Can Phyale’s eyes, filled as they were with fear and infatuation, ever
        dim in remembrance? To have known the unscrupulous inclination and to
        have indulged it—this alone enslaves us exaltedly to our loves, this
        alone is a bond. And time consecrates it, without undue pain.
        Indulgence, Diana! Otherwise, betrayal. Had I relented to your
        subsequent distancing, we would have missed a crucial bar. Indulgence,
        Diana. Thus only were we permitted to know ourselves in so adventitious
        a key. Indulgence.
        <br />
        <br />
        I knew her underlying leniency, yes. Once again, she gladdened at my
        sight, and her autobiography resumed. Then the setting of our play. At
        last, Yáñez ceased dictating our orbit. I followed Diana through the
        curated ruins that were her innocuous obsession, and she followed me
        through the befouled initiatives that were mine. Wherever we treaded,
        the melancholy impressions brought intimacy. Guadalajara has, at least,
        this merit among the nightmare cities: its efforts at self-reinvention
        are permanently undercut by its misshapen children, who, try as they
        might, contribute only to its unreality—all pragmatic motives diffuse
        into figments. Indeed, I came to wonder whether Diana and I were not
        dissipating in imitation. As if heedful, she extended her hand.
        <br />
        <br />
        The evening was slack—the enervated drivers talked of eight—bureaucrats
        gathered round a grungy stand, slumberous though somewhat awake to the
        desolate flirt; some trudged while others tried. Everything failed to
        coalesce. Everything, that is, which failed to trace Diana. There was
        nothing in the drenched vendors who cat-called youth, nothing in the
        trailing schizoids who screamed for touch, nothing in the tourists who
        basked in transience, nothing in the fathers who outlived lust, nothing
        in the mothers who outlived love. At this hour, I tensed in forethought.
        I was I as shadow of a larger triumph. All tentative steps had somehow
        led to a clearing, and there I collected. There would be no rest. There
        could be none. Still I thrust—
