        Moved into a bright house, pale-oak timber (cannibalistic), numerous
        rooms, spacious, airy, well-lit, sunbeams streaming in from yawning
        windows, high rafters of cottage-style exposed beams, fresh-pine smell
        emanating from decorative boughs (still living, un-slaughtered), main
        hallway splitting off into royal staircases, white bannisters, all
        constructed around a circle, countless rooms, multiple bathrooms, dining
        rooms, guest rooms, a nursery and playroom. The entirety of
        squirrel-palace wraps around a sturdy old oak tree holding the home
        aloft several stories above the forest floor with knotted, grandfather
        arms. I want to stay for a long, long time. I ask mom if we can keep it
        forever. She seems confused. <i>Not sure</i>, <i>honey</i>.

        Apollo has been sending out invitations to friends and extended
        acquaintances to stay in Tokyo over the upcoming summer break with his
        mom and Dennis. Apollo has been shilling crypto with Dennis who owns a
        printing factory harboring a stock of mining computers in the basement
        and lines of amphetamine. I’m not impressed.

        One early evening, Apollo comes to visit me in a drafty,
        minimalist-style condo with high ceilings and sparse, brutalist
        furniture populated by crowds of strangers, also groomed in
        minimalist-fashion. The mingling and champagne-sipping stifles my
        fragile, forest lungs. Piss-tone bubbles swirling about skinny, glass
        flutes are the only color against slate suits and black cocktail
        dresses. Oh, and the occasional red lip, popping like cherries on
        vanilla ice over bleached smiles. Teehee. I’m getting dizzy, dizzy.
        Following the tall, bent silhouette somehow darker than the accent
        ottoman in obsidian. He disappears and reappears behind the grand piano
        to steal an olive from a stranger’s (distant acquaintance’s) glass,
        moping like a sprained-ankle ballerino, as if the fallen locks
        half-obscuring gloomy eyes follow a lost choreography, sulking like a
        greyhound on a muddy race-track after the rain-cancellation.{" "}
        <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Apollo</i>. Never existed such a perfect pout, so
        kissable, so delectable. Only drinks served at this party. No catering.
        Dim lighting. The crystals of the unlit chandelier sparkling, rather,
        under force of our Apollo. Poor, pouting baby. Let me cheer you up.
        Allow me, please, within your vicinity. Catch you, tickle you. Turn that
        frown… Some time alone my one aching desire. Bidding for attention,
        serial failure. He&rsquo;s distracted and not in love. I’m dejected but
        not hopeless. I persist. Plainly before the crowds, I take my seat
        beside him on the Eames sofa, a harmonious combination of rich walnut,
        soft leather, and polished aluminum. I cannot raise my eyes, so much my
        heart races and limbs tingle at the mere proximity. At least, I hear
        none of the whispering expected, catch not a single peeved look. I
        realize I&rsquo;ve sat next to the wrong tall guy, <i>oops</i>! At long
        last, Apollo finds me himself, catches me at the doorway between one
        lounge-space and another. We leave together as three, unfortunately
        flanked by another distant acquaintance who swung unfavorably,
        distastefully, into orbit at the last moment.

        Misha, who leans into conversations in a conspiratorial fashion with a

        musical-dance-theater spectacle and casts me in all the numbers. The
        second number is a duet. He directs me to sing this peculiar phrase with
        just one line, each word 2 notes sort of high-pitched. I’m sure I don’t

        In the pool, someone finds a mangled baby with a dirty face. Horrifying.
        It’s been found killed by thrown stones. Flashbacks to a hospital scene.
        They are horrified, questioning how it happened as they gape at mangled
        limbs. Someone faints and, before a neighbor can catch her, drops her
        glass into the pool beside the premature, floating corpse. Poor, little
        baby, someone whispers with an audible slur.

        We enter the elevator. The doors shut immediately before giving any
        other guest a chance to enter. We descend to the bottom floor where I do
        not exit into the lobby but linger back until the doors shut once again
        with the same unnerving rapidity. I’m left alone thinking: how
        inconvenient, wanting to go grocery-shopping while staying in a dorm
        whose elevator continually slams shut without offering the chance to be
        held open for others. Imagine if your party gets split and you have to
        wait for the rest. Beyond irritating. Both inconvenient and inefficient.

        My sister keeps reaching grabby-hands for my backpack of snacks. I’m
        waiting in the cafeteria line, unable to make a decision over the menu.
        Having run out of money on my account, I’m worrying over whether to top
        up with my own funds or ask mom when another resident snaps a group
        selfie. Back in the dormitory, I’m starting to think my bunkmate above
        got the better deal. It’s tricky to make a conclusive appraisal between
        the convenience of having the bath so near the bottom bunk or, on the
        other hand, the privacy of elevation. What&rsquo;s more, there’s no
        walls between the bunks which fill the floor. My footsteps grow soggy as
        the bath, really a pool, begins to flood. Too many eager, bikini-clad
        girls, jostling about for the best seats, have displaced a wave of hot,
        chlorified water like a tsunami in miniature over the carpet. I make
        haste stripping down to take advantage of their foolish oversight of the
        empty jacuzzi.

        FOMO-ridden, I alchemize a double of myself in order to join the others
        in Tokyo. I arrive at the airport to follow my man. At customs, I show
        my palm and a spell to convince them I’ve got a passport. Upon landing,
        I ride a taxi to a massive dorm building where the reception offers me a
        complementary miniature figurine which I’m allowed to select from a
        diverse array. A difficult decision. Later, I discover the lunch buffet
        includes oversized, boiled lobsters and fish eggs (supposedly). Arriving
        late, little remains. Anyway, I’m mildly disgusted. The spread appears
        to be undercooked and vulgar, like raw monster tentacles in hentai. At
        sunset, I escape the dormitory under a spell intending to exercise my
        freedom in the open night. Snapping my fingers and rubbing my palms, I
        lift into the sky flying away. I twist and twirl through the city, wind
        chapping my cheeks, to explore this foreign land and maybe get a better
        meal.

        Tiny, precious kittens everywhere mewling. Both hands outspread, fingers
        wiggling to maximize on the infinite and absolute cuteness, I’m petting
        the flock with my sister in a messy dorm room, utterly slovenly, neither
        mine nor hers. Slovenly but without soil, rather a potential hoarding
        case, adorable collector’s objects and geek-material accumulated without
        rhyme or reason, neither basket nor filing cabinet, nameless plushies
        strewn about, all coated in ribbon and pastel lace. Our task: keep the
        cats inside so they become indoor cats. One cat of exceptional length
        attracts my attention. Despite the perfectly-proper ears, appropriately
        kitten-shaped and perched on the head, I cannot help but suspect hidden
        oddities alluded to by the cat’s abnormally long, worm-like form. Curled
        into a tight roly-poly-esque ball, I envision a half-dozen bug legs
        concealed beneath the calico fur. When I approach and oh-so gingerly pet
        the cat-erpillar for a closer inspection, the little mongrel bites me.
        Holding the injured hand, I pass a moment wondering whether the bite
        felt more like dainty, kitten teeth or massive, caterpillar mandibles
        which would’ve been pretty gross.

        I’m at the airport again, all packed and ready for Tokyo but at the tiny
        terminal I can&rsquo;t find my ticket. I have none, only for a bus from
        NYC. I need a ticket from London, ack! I beg the counter, isn’t there
        anything flying today to book instead of returning home or worse
        (shudder, horror of horrors) passing the night in a hotel? I use
        binoculars to peep at the landing pad, pixelated like a video game.
        Nothing. The air guards scurry about giving the effect of haste without
        direction like drugged ants. One large woman crossing the snow–an
        employee–pees herself and cries on the ground??? The others are a bit in
        shock, still others amused. I’m not in the worst mood considering I am
        stuck in this random place with no ticket.

        Finally meeting up with Apollo. He’s made a special effort for my
        birthday. I’m in a good mood when someone comments,
        <i>wait until you meet his girlfriend</i>. My stomach sinks, not daring
        to believe she’s real but even more petrified to ask. Still, I can’t
        avoid popping the question. Black cherry. Before he’s arrived, Apollo is
        gone, saying something about guarding himself because it’s not real.{" "}
        <i>We’re not real?</i> If only I could believe in myself more than the
        figmentary girlfriend. In the end, I’m feeling pretty off to put it
        mildly. Sugar rush. Saccharine speed. I try to reassure myself in a
        candy store. No luck. If only I were back in Paris, I could’ve planned
        to catch up with my best girlfriend for a concert in Châtelet instead of
        moping alone around another foreign city where figments hold more water
        than the faith of my own minor god in me. How to turn down the mocking
        lights of Shibuya. Billboards blaring so that I want to clap both hands
        over my ears. My cutesy ear-muffs with patchwork petals and peach-fuzz
        lining aren’t doing the trick. Hey, you! Lift up that quivering chin and
        look around! Discover all forms of entertainment refined and consumable,

        <span className={styles.alternateTitleColorFour}>23 </span>All the
        models together, gathered by some enigmatic promoter for an exclusive
        VIP ryokan package: a traditional Japanese inn that typically features
        tatami floors, futon bedding, communal baths, and often serves
        multi-course Japanese meals for a unique, cultural experience, the
        unspoken assumption being that us, the foreign models just recently
        introduced and mixed in with the local staff beauties, constitute a key
        aspect of this “cultural experience” for the paying male clients,
        fostering a sense of luxury and not to mention sensuality. Naomi says
        it’s nice to be able to share pants that fit. She’s got a sweet smile
        that takes up most of her miniscule, ballerina face. We’ve wandered far
        from the village inn into some misty, forest location for an indie film
        festival hosted around a reddish barn, reddish like rust, on a commune.
        This one micro-celebrity has been after my sister, in attendance as a
        presenting director for her nominated debut short. Magnetized by her
        rustic, auburn beauty and artistic integrity, he chases her through the
        farmstead stadium. The pursuit leaps bullfrog creeks and the wood-fences
        dividing pastures of sheep from hens. She’s as nimble as any
        bushy-tailed woodland rodent, but he is relentless. Super aggressive. I
        extend a well-timed shin and trip that guy. Splat! He plants his face
        flat in a pile of hot cow dung. Apparently, someone has been neglecting
        their chores as tends to occur within a farming collective established
        upon the NAP (non-aggression principle). No sweat off my back. I’m
        grateful for the slip. Meanwhile, a rural doctor, a homeopath and
        midwife, exhibits his birthing skills. He asks for a volunteer (doesn’t
        need to be pregnant). <i>Wow</i>, <i>works so well</i>!

        Back home, Apollo has been waiting for me, hiding out at the old cottage
        farmhouse where my stepdad lurks, unsubtly stalking under the thin guise
        of tending beehives all around the perimeter of the property, desperate
        for any excuse to peep in on my family, mainly my mom, obviously. But my stepdad’s
        not concerned with me and my man, my minor god, my golden sunshine boy
        with the bad posture. At long last, we’ve found a moment together in
        peace, long uninterrupted hours turn into days until I lose track. I
        love my door. But we can’t stay locked inside for infinity, even
        immortal gods need to pee and make a run to the corner store for a
        snack. I tell him about the local landscape, how we don’t have
        convenience stores like in the city/suburbs but general stores like
        historic relics or hallmark cards, ornamented by antique signage, filled
        with farm-fresh produce and locally-sourced goods like thistle cheddar,
        licorice twists, blackberry soft-serve and maple donuts from the Red Hen
        bakery. Our tummies grumble in sync. Why do I sneak him anyway? My
        sister keeps a partner in her bedroom at home. We should be fine.

        Engaging in intercourse with a twink in a big, dark room. Or rather, an
        androgynous figure who identifies as a man. I&rsquo;m confused. Maybe
        it&rsquo;s the swollen member that&rsquo;s disorienting me. Fear rises
        from my empty gut, the overwhelming emotion. I’m scared of it. I try to
        avoid it. It fills me with disgust. If I could fly, I’d be back in my
        treehouse. I’m only a squirrel. I can’t see anything in the dark, only
        shifting forms. As forewarned, the medication has significantly
        deteriorated my night-vision. Squinting like a blind mole, a blind
        squirrel, I brace myself with two open palms as if for impact.
