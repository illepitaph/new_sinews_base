        Moved into a bright house, pale-oak timber (cannibalistic), numerous
        rooms, spacious, airy, well-lit, sunbeams streaming in from yawning
        windows, high rafters of cottage-style exposed beams, fresh-pine smell
        emanating from decorative boughs (still living, un-slaughtered), main
        hallway splitting off into royal staircases, white bannisters,
        constructing a round circle, countless rooms, multiple bathrooms, dining
        rooms, guest rooms, a nursery and playroom. The entirety of
        squirrel-palace wraps around a sturdy old oak tree holding the home
        aloft several stories above the forest floor with knotted, grandfather
        arms. I want to stay for a long, long time. I ask mom if we can keep it
        forever. She seems confused. <i>Not sure</i>, <i>honey</i>.

        Apollo has been sending out invitations to friends and extended
        acquaintances to stay in Tokyo over the upcoming summer break with his
        mom and Dennis. Apollo has been shilling crypto with Dennis who owns a
        printing factory harboring a stock of mining computers in the basement
        beside lines of amphetamine. I’m not impressed. White powder clouds
        woodland nostrils. Huffing sawdust, I’d prefer. Like the tragic puffing
        of timber trunks sheared and shaved for smooth planks. Slaughterers in
        the woods, harvesting thick, oak fruits for construction. But then we
        reascend the dozen or so floors to the top where the balcony wraps
        around spills over the side of the skyscraper into the wobbling neons
        deep below. I half-spill myself over the railing and gulp in the
        twilight air mixing with the soggy depths, cooler after summer sunset
        and thinner at maximum elevation. And the vertigo almost nearly makes me
        forget I’m trapped in concrete. This is <i>their</i> home city. The
        pedestrians who don’t startle at the screaming machines or blaring,
        electric foliage yet distress over the consumption of wild berries.{" "}
        <i>Dirty</i>, <i>bleh</i>, <i>poison</i>! I’m distressed over the
        consumption. Preordained and prepackaged. I have no homecity. I&rsquo;m
        no city-slicking woman though I&rsquo;m looking like one in the tallest
        leather boots. I’m a berry forager. Nuts and seeds too. Wild bird eggs
        scrambled or fried. The peas and carrots peeking from community garden
        plots. Tree bark and leaf buds for the texture and bitterness if bored.
        I’m a squirrel with tall shoes and a long wig. But we met, me and the
        god of Sun and light, for the first time in such a place, sharp and
        concrete, after I’d been dragged half-willingly from the safe place with
        acorns to find an <i>institution of learning</i>. Now maybe he’s hooked
        me. It’s really a trap, just like they warned. But if I run in this
        overpopulated, artificially-constructed environment, surely I’ll end up
        roadkill. I’ve barely learned to read a red light. For the time being, I
        keep skimming down the west coast, trying not to wallow.

        One early evening, Apollo comes to visit me in a drafty,
        minimalist-style condo with high ceilings and sparse, brutalist
        furniture populated by crowds of strangers, also groomed in
        minimalist-fashion. Silicone pillows in pairs, squeezed into black
        tubes, bounce about in such obligatory plenitude. The mingling and champagne-sipping stifles my fragile,
        forest lungs. Piss-tone bubbles swirling about skinny, glass flutes are
        the only color against slate suits and black cocktail dresses. Oh, and
        the occasional red lip, popping like cherries on vanilla ice over
        bleached smiles. Teehee. I’m getting dizzy, dizzy. Following the tall,
        bent silhouette somehow darker than the accent ottoman in obsidian. He
        disappears and reappears behind the grand piano to steal an olive from a
        stranger’s (distant acquaintance’s) glass, moping like a sprained-ankle
        ballerino, as if the fallen locks half-obscuring gloomy eyes follows a
        lost choreography, sulking like a greyhound on a muddy race-track after
        the rain-cancellation. <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Apollo</i>. Never existed such
        a perfect pout, so kissable, so delectable. Only drinks served at this
        party. No catering. Dim lighting. The crystals of the unlit chandelier
        sparkling, rather, under force of our Apollo. Poor, pouting baby. Let me
        cheer you up. Allow me, please, within your vicinity. Catch you, tickle
        you. Turn that frown… Some time alone my one aching desire. Bidding for
        attention, serial failure. He&rsquo;s distracted and not in love.
        I&rsquo;m dejected but not hopeless. I persist. Plainly before the
        crowds, I take my seat beside him on the Eames sofa, a harmonious
        combination of rich walnut, soft leather, and polished aluminum. I
        cannot raise my eyes, so much my heart races and limbs tingle at the
        mere proximity. At least, I hear none of the whispering expected, catch
        not a single peeved look. I realize I&rsquo;ve sat next to the wrong
        tall guy, <i>oops!</i> At long last, Apollo finds me himself, catches me
        at the doorway between one lounge-space and another. We leave together
        as three, unfortunately flanked by another distant acquaintance who
        swung unfavorably, distastefully, into orbit at the last moment.

        <i>The classroom of a sort of private school</i>,{" "}
        <i>a big industrial building in a deserted wasteland</i>. Summer fever
        has begun creeping in. Yet until vacation, we strain to maintain focus.
        Professor Misha, who leans into conversations in a conspiratorial
        fashion with a thinning but attractive head, is composing an
        Easter-special musical-dance-theater spectacle and casts me in all the
        numbers. The second number is a duet. He directs me to sing this
        peculiar phrase with just one line, each word 2 notes sort of
        high-pitched. I’m sure I don’t have it right but we’ve only just begun,
        assures Misha, so it’s fine. <i>Don’t worry</i>, <i>darling</i>. He’s
        choosing me for everything, why? I wonder if this means he’ll invite me
        at last for blini and caviar.

        When the invitation finally arrives, it&rsquo;s not for an intimate
        dinner but as a +1 to a private fundraiser out in Berkeley. The crowd is
        much older here, home-dyed undergraduate students and new-growth,
        vintage-tee-blazer entrepreneurs have been replaced with mid-career
        business men and graying stock brokers. My appearance (groomed but too
        hip, undone like gooey brownies… <i>on purpose</i>) aligns closer to the
        servers than the guests. Even these statuesque boys, however, who offer
        dill on rye sandwich bites, have been fitted in threads beyond my
        bracket. The floor-length windows are all open to the evening air that
        carries in salt from the bay, circulating the stale odor of No 5 Chanel
        with a breathable refreshment. I assume it&rsquo;s the sunset luring the
        crowd out en masse to the patio. I don’t have a clue why else I’d be
        having to elbow through a crowd wrapped around the pool, guarding my
        glass from projectile shoulders and elbows. Bobbing like a toy boat over
        the aquamarine chlorine, someone has found a mangled baby with a dirty
        face. Horrifying. It’s been found killed by thrown stones. Flashbacks to
        a hospital scene, a young mother, an operating table surrounded by
        surgical masks obscuring male faces, wolf-eyed beneath bushy brows.
        Flash-forward to the present, populated by all genders. All horrified,
        astounded, questioning how it happened as they gape at mangled limbs.
        Someone faints and, before a neighbor can catch her, she lets slip from
        manicured hands her champagne flute into the pool beside the premature,
        floating corpse. <i>Poor</i>, <i>little baby</i>, someone whispers with
        an audible slur. The party disperses at last once the pool boy—summoned
        by a sober server of especially statuesque biceps and a cascade of blond
        rivulets—employs the bug net. Bodies mingle in the library, around the
        coffee tables. Only smokers retrace to the balcony and with reluctance
        to gaze downstairs at the patio and the unpleasant view of blue-lit
        chlorine. Conversation returns to the optimal vacation investments, the
        endearing achievements of progeniture rung off with feigned humility, an
        exchanging critique of the hors-d&rsquo;oeuvres, punctuated by an aghast
        clapping of the chest in response to this or that overseas headline.{" "}
        <i> Poor</i>, <i>poor</i>, <i>but what is to be done</i>? The only other
        case of fainting that night followed the virgin inhalation of a
        recreational class of drugs of the alkyl nitrate family.

        My sister keeps reaching grabby-hands for my backpack of snacks. Two
        weeks until summer. I’m waiting in the cafeteria line, reigning
        contemplation over the menu as if unable to make a decision. In reality,
        having run out of money on my account, I’m fretting over whether to top
        up with my own funds or ask mom. Unlike little sisters with cravings as
        superficial as their attention spans, big sisters cannot subsist on
        fruit leathers and granola bars alone. I’m beginning to chew my lip,
        frantic between the feigned menu focus and financial puzzle when another
        resident snaps a group selfie. The flash breaks me from reverie and
        leaves me staring dumbly as if into headlights, cheeks burning. Back in
        the dormitory, I’m starting to suspect my bunkmate above got the better
        deal. It’s tricky to make a conclusive appraisal between the convenience
        of having the bath so near the bottom bunk or, on the other hand, the
        privacy of elevation. What&rsquo;s more, there are no walls between the
        beds which fill the floor. Just one of the many architectural
        inconsistencies typical of a filthy rich private school ruled by a
        gluttonous administration. My footsteps grow soggy as the bath, really a
        pool, begins to flood. Too many eager, bikini-clad girls and other
        non-male students—jostling about for the best seats—have displaced a
        turquoise wave of mineral-salty water like a tsunami in miniature over
        the carpet. I make haste flinging wet socks, stripping down to take
        advantage of their foolish oversight. Squirting a generous dollop of
        strawberry bubble-bath, I sink into the empty jacuzzi. <br />

        Tiny, precious kittens everywhere mewling. Both hands outspread, fingers
        wiggling to maximize on the infinite and absolute cuteness, I’m petting
        the flock with my sister in a messy dorm room, utterly slovenly, neither
        mine nor hers. Slovenly but without soil, rather a potential hoarding
        case, adorable collector’s objects and geek-material accumulated without
        rhyme or reason, neither basket nor filing cabinet, nameless plushies
        strewn about, all coated in ribbon and pastel lace. Our task: keep the
        cats inside so they become indoor cats. One cat of exceptional length
        attracts my attention. Despite the perfectly-proper ears, appropriately
        kitten-shaped and perched on the head, I cannot help but suspect hidden
        oddities alluded to by the cat’s abnormally long, worm-like form. Curled
        into a tight roly-poly-esque ball, I envision a half-dozen bug legs
        concealed beneath the calico fur. When I approach and oh-so gingerly pet
        the cat-erpillar for a closer inspection, the little mongrel bites me.
        Holding the injured hand, I pass a moment wondering whether the bite
        felt more like dainty, kitten teeth or massive, caterpillar mandibles
        which would’ve been pretty gross.

        No sooner does the last school bell ring than I’m at the airport, all
        packed and ready for Tokyo but at the tiny terminal I can&rsquo;t find
        my ticket. I have none, only for a bus from NYC. I need a ticket from
        San Francisco, <i>ack</i>! I beg the counter, isn’t there anything
        flying today to book instead of returning home or worse (shudder, horror
        of horrors) passing the night in a hotel? I use binoculars to peep at
        the landing pad, pixelated like a video game. Nothing. The air guards
        scurry about giving the effect of haste without direction like drugged
        ants. One large woman crossing the snow—an employee—pees herself and
        cries on the ground??? The others are a bit in shock, still others
        amused. I’m not in the worst mood considering I am stuck in this random
        place with no ticket.

        Humidity of the seventh floor. June sweat has already begun to bead
        under the exertion of bearing such hefty shopping bags, taken as
        compensation for being still stuck in the Occident. Recycled Popmart and
        Miniso serve as our baskets brimming with hand-prepared picnic
        delicacies and sparkling bottles. Cucumber and dill on rye has returned,
        now accompanied by whipped-cream-strawberry sandwiches on fluffy milk
        bread, deviled eggs, caprese skewers, ambrosia salad, baby quiches and
        lemon-blueberry scones. Classes have been out of session for over a
        month and I’m deeper down the west coast than I ever intended to reach.
        We enter the elevator, stifling heat. The weather is hot, but we are
        cool. Dark sunnies, tiny fitted tops. Two girls, almost identical but
        for chromatically contrasting coiffures. Noelle’s bob is black, mine
        more reddish in hue. Upon closer inspection–closer than any of these
        casting directors ever care to take, and nothing a little photoshop
        can’t fix—the tights beneath my mini skirt conceal furry legs of the
        same color. We both stand taller than the average man, not including the
        stilettos, limbs extended like in a warped, horror-house mirror.
        Catching a glimpse in the reflective door, I imitate Noelle’s pout and
        almond-sliver eyes to assure a foolproof casting, last of the day before
        we’re free to picnic. Free to frolic our bare, pedicured toes in the
        clover grass. If I land even a fraction of Noelle’s jobs, as I’ve
        managed so far, I’ll be in the airport by next month. The city of angels
        offers ample rewards to the girls most agile in leaping through the
        rings of their beauty ideal. Picnic as compensation for remaining stuck
        behind, but also the celebratory checkpoint towards affording a round
        trip flight and catching up. Glossed, puckering and slick, we descend to
        the ground floor.

        FOMO-ridden, I alchemize a double of myself in order to join the others
        in Tokyo. I leave my shadow to run castings and pose for the cameras, as
        I shuttle to the airport in pursuit of my radiant fixation, bearing
        nothing more than a dense backpack and cross-body bag balancing style
        with utility. At customs, I show my palm and a spell to convince the
        burly men I’ve got a proper passport. Upon landing, I catch a taxi to
        the hotel and arrive by sunset. With my key, the receptionist offers me
        a complementary miniature figurine which I’m allowed to select from a
        diverse array, each figure a chibi-petite doll embodying a unique
        element of hospitality: fresh linen, bubble bath, room service, rooftop
        bar, free coffee, swimming pool, wifi. A difficult decision but I go
        with my gut and take continental breakfast. Floor 15 reads my key.
        Continuing in obedience to my gut which elevates in volume, I rapidly
        ascend, unpack in a flash and descend. Much to my dismay, I discover the
        dinner buffet includes oversized, boiled lobsters and fish eggs
        (supposedly). Arriving at the end of the service, the wait staff has
        already commenced closing duties and slim provisions remain. At any
        rate, I’m mildly disgusted. The spread appears to be undercooked and
        vulgar, like raw monster tentacles in hentai. At sunset, I escape the
        dormitory under a spell intending to exercise my freedom in the open
        night. Snapping my fingers and rubbing my palms, I lift into the sky.
        Up, up and away. I twist and twirl through the city, wind chapping my
        cheeks, to explore this foreign land and maybe nab a better meal. No
        hate for tentacles, but grill them at least. Or take the enfants fried
        in green-onion batter, skewered and sprinkled with bonito flakes and
        green aonori, drizzled with tangy BBQ and Kewpie mayo.

        Finally meeting up with Apollo. He’s made a special effort for my
        birthday. I’m in a good mood when someone unwelcome leans in real close
        to whisper with hot, putrid-smelling breath,{" "}
        <i>wait until you meet his girlfriend</i>. Could that be the putridity
        of jealousy or just my wishful thinking, recoiling from the stench of
        gossip. I fathom. My stomach sinks, not daring to believe she’s real but
        even more petrified to ask. We spent our first hours together like that,
        with me petrified as wood: lacking oxygen, slowly decaying, allowing
        minerals to replace cell walls and fill my void spaces. I’m gritting my
        teeth to remain pleasant. Still, I can’t avoid popping the question.
        Black cherry. Before he’s arrived, Apollo is gone, saying something
        about guarding himself because it’s not real. <i>We’re not real?</i> If
        only I could believe in myself more than the figmentary girlfriend. In
        the end, I’m feeling pretty off to put it mildly. I seek consolation in
        a candy store. Sugar rush. Saccharine speed. I’ve always harbored
        addictive tendencies. When life gets hard, marshmallows. After they’ve
        all left, bubblegum. My heart growls. My gut seeks. The insulation of
        cotton candy, the forgetfulness of licorice, the sympathy of jelly
        beans. No luck. I’m bitter as the darkest dark chocolate. Hard as
        toffee. Sour as sours. My tummy hurts even more than it did before. If
        only I were back in California (a thought I never imagined myself
        forming), I could’ve caught up with my best girlfriend for a seaside
        concert instead of moping alone around another foreign city where
        figments hold more weight than the faith of my own minor god in me. How
        to turn down the mocking lights of Shibuya. Billboards blaring so that I
        want to clap both hands over my ears. My adorable ear-muffs with
        patchwork petals and peach-fuzz lining aren’t doing the trick. Hey, you!

        models together, gathered by some enigmatic promotor for an exclusive
        VIP ryokan package: a traditional Japanese inn that typically features
        tatami floors, futon bedding, communal baths, and often serves
        multi-course Japanese meals for a unique, cultural experience, the 10
        unspoken assumption being that us, the foreign models just recently
        introduced and mixed in with the local staff beauties, constitute a key
        aspect of this “cultural experience” for the paying male clients,
        fostering a sense of luxury not to mention sensuality. Naomi says
        it’s nice to be able to share pants that fit. She’s got a sweet smile
        that takes up most of her miniscule, ballerina face. I return the smile
        with a nose crinkle that twitches my whiskers. Teetering in my
        absolutely tallest pair of stilettos and silkiest wig, I’m feeling like
        it&rsquo;s nearly time to go home. I’ve taken this city-business far
        enough.

        We’ve wandered far from the village inn into some misty, forest location
        for an indie film festival hosted around a reddish barn, reddish like
        rust, on a commune. This one micro-celebrity has been after my sister,
        chasing her through the farmstead stadium. Super aggressive. I extend a
        well-timed shin and trip the guy. Splat! He plants his face flat in a
        pile of hot cow dung. Apparently, someone has been neglecting their
        chores as tends to occur within a farming collective established upon
        the NAP. No sweat off my back. I’m grateful for the slip. Meanwhile, a
        rural doctor, a homeopath and midwife, exhibits his birthing skills. He
        asks for a volunteer (doesn’t need to be pregnant). <i>Wow</i>,{" "}

        Back home, Apollo has been waiting for me all along. Waiting to surprise
        me, he hides out at the old cottage farmhouse where my stepdad lurks,
        unsubtly stalking under the thin guise of tending beehives all around
        the perimeter of the property, desperate for any excuse to peep in on my
        tender family, mainly my mother. He’s not concerned with my shenanigans,
        my golden sunshine boy with the bad posture. At long last, we’ve found a
        moment together in peace. Long uninterrupted hours might stretch into
        days until I lose track. I love my door. But we can’t stay 11 locked
        inside for infinity. We’ve barely settled on the bed before our tummies
        grumble in sync. Even immortal gods need to make a run to the corner
        store for a snack. I tell him about the local landscape, how we don’t
        have convenience stores like in the city/suburbs but general stores like
        historic relics ornamented by antique signage, filled with farm-fresh
        produce and locally-sourced goods like thistle cheddar, licorice twists,
        blackberry soft-serve and cider donuts. I keep reminiscing until I’m
        alone. The sun has set.

        Cradled in silky darkness, luxurious midnight, I lay sprawled over a
        king-size mattress wrapped in fresh linen sheets, engaging in
        intercourse with an androgynous figure who identifies as a female. Or
        was it vice versa. I&rsquo;m confused. Maybe it&rsquo;s the swollen
        member that&rsquo;s disorienting me. Fear rises from my empty gut to
        overwhelm all other emotions. I&rsquo;m scared of it. I try to avoid it.
        It fills me with disgust. If I could fly, I’d be back in my treehouse.
        My woodland palace. After all, I’m only a squirrel. Only a tufted, red
        squirrel with a nose that twitches at the sound of loud footsteps in the
        crunchy, fallen leaves blazing with all the colors of the sunset and a
        tail that balances my nimble body as I scamper and leap between the
        bouncing boughs of the forest canopy. But I’ve lost my tail, perhaps on
        the metro, and have received in exchange this pair of long legs, smooth
        as melted sugar that spread apart. With the aid of my hands, I close
        these legs, so disproportionate, and stumble onto them standing, propped
        as if between two marble columns. They quiver but hold strong. I can’t
        see anything in the dark, only shifting forms. As forewarned, the
        medication has significantly deteriorated my night-vision. Squinting
        like a blind mole, a blind squirrel, I brace myself with two open palms
        as if for impact.
