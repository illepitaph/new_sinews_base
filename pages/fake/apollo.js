        Moved into a bright house, pale-oak timber (cannibalistic), numerous
        rooms, spacious, airy, well-lit, sunbeams streaming in from yawning
        windows, high rafters of cottage-style exposed beams, fresh-pine smell
        emanating from decorative boughs (still living, un-slaughtered), main
        hallway splitting off into royal staircases, white bannisters,
        constructing a round circle, countless rooms, multiple bathrooms, dining
        rooms, guest rooms, a nursery and playroom. The entirety of
        squirrel-palace wraps around a sturdy old oak tree holding the home
        aloft several stories above the forest floor with knotted, grandfather
        arms. I want to stay for a long, long time. I ask mom if we can keep it
        forever. She seems confused. <i>Not sure</i>, <i>honey</i>.

        Apollo has been sending out invitations to friends and extended
        acquaintances to stay in Tokyo over summer break with his mom and
        Dennis. He has been shilling crypto with Dennis who owns a printing
        factory harboring a stock of mining computers in the basement beside
        lines of amphetamine. I’m not impressed. White powder clouds woodland
        nostrils. Huffing sawdust, I’d prefer. Like the tragic puffing of timber
        trunks sheared and shaved for smooth planks. Slaughterers in the woods,
        harvesting thick, oak fruits for construction. But then we reascend the
        dozen or so floors to the top where the balcony wraps around spills over
        the side of the skyscraper into the wobbling neons deep below. I
        half-spill myself over the railing and gulp in the twilight air mixing
        with the soggy depths, cooler after summer sunset and thinner at maximum
        elevation. And the vertigo almost nearly makes me forget I’m trapped in
        concrete. This is <i>their</i> home city. The pedestrians who don’t
        startle at the screaming machines or blaring, electric foliage yet
        distress over the consumption of wild berries. <i>Dirty</i>, <i>bleh</i>
        , <i>poison</i>! I’m distressed over the consumption. Preordained and
        prepackaged. I have no homecity. I&rsquo;m no city-slicking woman though I&rsquo;m
        looking like one in the tallest leather boots. I’m a berry forager. Nuts
        and seeds too. Wild bird eggs scrambled or fried. The peas and carrots
        peeking from community garden plots. Tree bark and leaf buds for the
        texture and bitterness if bored. I’m a squirrel with tall shoes and a
        long wig. But we met, me and the god of Sun and light, for the first
        time in such a place, sharp and concrete, after I’d been dragged
        half-willingly from the safe place with acorns to find an{" "}
        <i>institution of learning</i>. Now maybe he’s hooked me. It’s really a
        trap, just like they warned. But if I run in this overpopulated,
        artificially-constructed environment, surely I’ll end up roadkill. I’ve
        barely learned to read a red light. For the time being, I keep skimming
        down the west coast, trying not to wallow.
        <br />
        <br />
        One early evening, Apollo comes to visit me in a drafty,
        minimalist-style condo with high ceilings and sparse, brutalist
        furniture populated by crowds of strangers, also groomed in
        minimalist-fashion. Silicone pillows in pairs, squeezed into black
        tubes, bounce about in such plenitude as if punnily teasing the nickname
        silicon valley. The mingling and champagne-sipping stifles my fragile,
        forest lungs. Piss-tone bubbles swirling about skinny, glass flutes are
        the only color against slate suits and black cocktail dresses. Oh, and
        the occasional red lip, popping like cherries on vanilla ice over
        bleached smiles. Teehee. I’m getting dizzy, dizzy. Following the tall,
        bent silhouette somehow darker than the accent ottoman in obsidian. He
        disappears and reappears behind the grand piano to steal an olive from a
        stranger’s (distant acquaintance’s) glass, moping like a sprained-ankle
        ballerino, as if the fallen locks half-obscuring gloomy eyes follows a
        lost choreography, sulking like a greyhound on a muddy race-track after
        the rain-cancellation. <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Apollo</i>. Never existed such
        a perfect pout, so kissable, so delectable. Only drinks served at this
        party. No catering. Dim lighting. The crystals of the unlit chandelier
        sparkling, rather, under force of our Apollo. Poor, pouting baby. Let me
        cheer you up. Allow me, please, within your vicinity. Catch you, tickle
        you. Turn that frown… Some time alone my one aching desire. Bidding for
        attention, serial failure. He&rsquo;s distracted and not in love. I&rsquo;m dejected
        but not hopeless. I persist. Plainly before the crowds, I take my seat
        beside him on the Eames sofa, a harmonious combination of rich walnut,
        soft leather, and polished aluminum. I cannot raise my eyes, so much my
        heart races and limbs tingle at the mere proximity. At least, I hear
        none of the whispering expected, catch not a single peeved look. I
        realize I&rsquo;ve sat next to the wrong tall guy, <i>oops</i>! At long last,
        Apollo finds me himself, catches me at the doorway between one
        lounge-space and another. We leave together as three, unfortunately
        flanked by another distant acquaintance who swung unfavorably,
        distastefully, into orbit at the last moment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kept_Male’s house was shimmering in the morning light, and the couple
        complimented his work, running their hands over his stone walls, and
        pointing out chairs and tables that they’d like to have sex on.
        PhoneBaby21 cooked them breakfast in the kitchen, and Kept_Male watched
        her, wishing he could tell the blonde man and silver woman to leave.
        They told her about the threesome on the beach. <i>It</i>’
        <i>s cool that you</i>’<i>re so free with yourself</i>, PhoneBaby said,
        smiling at him with her big teeth. <i>Thank you</i>, he said. The four
        of them had sex over the kitchen counter, scattering uneaten plates of
        toast and eggs, PhoneBaby21 spreading her magnificent thighs for the big
        blonde man. Kept_Male watched her, thinking of the small room in her
        unfinished condo, wishing he could fall asleep next to her in the tub.
        <br />
        <br />
        And finally, now, PhoneBaby21 and Kept_Male announce their engagement at
        KruzKontrol. The blonde man and silver woman, who go by Leena and Claud,
        are in fact throwing them a lavish party. The space is full of balloons,
        and fresh flowers are strung from the ceilings, four-foot birds of
        paradise and clusters of orchids. Claud takes Kept_Male to the bathroom,
        where he gives him a celebratory blow job. <i>I</i>’
        <i>m proud of you</i>, Claud says, gently placing Kept_Male’s penis back
        in his pants. PhoneBaby21 has invited hundreds of friends and they crowd
        around Kept_Male, hugging him and caressing his face, while PhoneBaby21
        dances with Leena and Claud. <i>I</i>’
        <i>m so excited to start a family</i>, PhoneBaby announces to the crowd,
        and they cheer and gyrate, holding up their phones to take pictures and
        videos.
        <br />
        <br />
        PhoneBaby21 leaves her condo and moves in with Kept_Male. She loves the
        oak tree that grows straight through Kept_Male’s Falling Water house.
        She loves the long, low couches and big rectangular windows, where green
        light cascades through in bright sheets. They talk about setting a date
        for their wedding, but neither of them cares much about that. All
        PhoneBaby21 talks about these days is starting a family. She and Leena
        spend hours scrolling through Adoption Boards and reading through
        potential children’s profiles. <i>This one sounds good</i>, Leena says,
        showing them an ad on the Adoption Daily website. Imogen is a healthy
        three-year-old, with sparse red hair and round chubby cheeks. <i>I</i>’
        <i>m looking for an incredibly mature couple to call Mom and Dad</i>,
        her ad reads. <i>No bullshit</i>, <i>no fighting</i>.{" "}
        <i>I want to be cared for twenty-four-seven NO EXCEPTIONS</i>.{" "}
        <i>I am willing to party as long as I</i>’<i>m taken care of</i>.{" "}
        <i>I love to be pampered</i>, <i>so spoil me rotten</i>! <i>I</i>’
        <i>m vivacious</i>, <i>ornery</i>, <i>and very intelligent</i>!{" "}
        <i>Must be willing and able to discipline me</i>.{" "}
        <i>Send me a message to set up an interview</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>I</i>’<i>m nervous</i>, squeals PhoneBaby21. Kept_Male squints at
        Imogen’s picture. <i>She</i>’<i>s big for a three-year-old</i>, he says.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>She</i>’<i>s healthy</i>, PhoneBaby says, pushing him away.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imogen agrees to meet for an interview. She suggests they talk over
        drinks at the sculpture museum downtown. <i>I</i>’
        <i>ll meet you in the back garden</i>, she messages PhoneBaby21.
        Kept_Male wears his favorite mesh tank top and white shorts. He grows
        his hair longer, and slicks it back, wanting Imogen to be impressed.
        PhoneBaby21 wears plastic see-through pants and a neon yellow halter
        top. She braids her hair and spends hours perfecting her tan. They wind
        their way through the sculpture garden, too nervous to comment on the
        cubist nudes, which tower over them, water gently pouring from their
        mouths and genitals. The grass spreads out like a deep carpet, and the
        garden has enormous rose bushes that sag with pink and red flowers. They
        sit under a willow tree and wait. <i>I think that</i>’<i>s her</i>,
        PhoneBaby21 says, reaching for Kept_Male. Imogen is walking towards them
        on stumpy toddler legs, and she has a bonnet on over her thinning hair.
        She sits on the grass in front of them, and PhoneBaby21 rushes to pull a
        sweater from her bag. <i>Here</i>, <i>little one</i>.{" "}
        <i>I don’t want you to get a rash</i>. Imogen allows herself to be
        picked up, while Kept_Male spreads the sweater carefully across the
        grass. Imogen’s face is bigger than it looked in the pictures, and her
        cheeks are sweaty and misshapen. Kept_Male thinks she’s too tall to be
        three. <i>You’re precious</i>, PhoneBaby21 coos at her. <i>Thank you</i>
        , Imogen says, and sucks on her thumb, her small brown eyes watching
        Kept_Male.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imogen asks them about their salary, their favorite clubs, restaurants,
        and museums. <i>I love art</i>, Imogen says,{" "}
        <i>
          and I really can’t see myself in a family that doesn’t feel the same
          way
        </i>
        . PhoneBaby21 describes Kept_Male’s house, and Imogen shrugs.{" "}
        <i>It sounds nice</i>, <i>but I</i>’
        <i>d have to see it in person before I make any final decisions</i>.{" "}
        <i>Are you really only twenty-one</i>? She cocks a beady stare at
        PhoneBaby21, who blushes. <i>No</i>. <i>I</i>’<i>m in my forties</i>.
        Imogen is pleased to hear this and asks if PhoneBaby is willing to
        breastfeed. She asks about their sex life, their eating habits, and how
        often they vacation. <i>I need a big allowance</i>, Imogen says, untying
        the bonnet. She brushes back the flighty strands of red hair that are
        sticking to her scalp. PhoneBaby21 tells her about Leena and Claud and
        shows her a picture of them from the engagement party at KruzKontrol.{" "}
        <i>Do you get jealous</i>? Imogen asks Kept_Male. He smiles at the
        little baby and pinches her sweaty cheek a little harder than he meant
        to. <i>No</i>, he says. <i>Imogen</i>,{" "}
        <i>would you like something to drink</i>? Imogen bats her eyes and says
        she loves orange juice. Kept_Male is relieved to get up, to be moving,
        and he walks slowly through the sculpture garden to the vending machine.
        He wishes PhoneBaby21 hadn’t said she was in her forties. He drinks a
        beer, frothy and warm from sitting in the sun, and watches the sun
        bounce off the sculptures, their thin fountains of water misting the air
        around him.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imogen messages PhoneBaby a week later, and says she’s decided to let
        them adopt her. PhoneBaby collapses to the floor when she reads the
        message, and Kept_Male kneels beside her, asking her what’s wrong.{" "}
        <i>Nothing</i>’<i>s wrong</i>, PhoneBaby says, her great green eyes
        pooling with tears. <i>I</i>’<i>m just so goddamned happy</i>. Kept_Male
        arranges for Imogen to sleep in a massive bedroom on the second floor.
        She asks for neutral colors only, and he repaints the walls and buys new
        sheets. <i>She can only sleep if they’re one hundred percent silk</i>,
        PhoneBaby tells him.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imogen agrees to an adoption day party, and they cater the event,
        inviting the DJ from KruzKontrol to play a set in their living room. The
        house is crowded, with people posing for pictures on the balconies that
        jut out over the waterfall, breasts overflowing tight ballgowns and six
        packs straining the buttons of dress shirts. PhoneBaby has dressed
        Imogen in a black leather romper, with a large latex bonnet and patent
        Mary Jane’s. They glide through the party, Imogen smiling, or sucking
        her thumb, or clasped onto PhoneBaby’s nipple, her enormous breast
        bouncing free from her slinky gown. <i>You</i>’<i>re glowing</i>, Leena
        and Claud shriek, bending to kiss Imogen’s bonnet, wrapping them both in
        a hug. Kept_Male watches as PhoneBaby feeds Imogen caviar, watches as
        Imogen bats the spoon away, her face red and angry. She begins to
        scream, and the guests turn, sending PhoneBaby winks and sympathetic
        smiles and making quiet <i>tsking</i> sounds.{" "}
        <i>I think she wants you</i>, PhoneBaby says to Kept_Male, handing him
        Imogen, whose bonnet is sitting sidewise on her head, a dark wash of
        caviar and snot smeared across her cheek. <i>Daddy</i>, wails Imogen,
        beating his face with her fists. He adjusts her bonnet and wipes her
        cheek clean with a napkin. <i>I think she wants you to spank her</i>,
        PhoneBaby says, ushering them to the bathroom. Kept_Male sits Imogen on
        the sink, watching her enormous face crease and dimple as she screams
        and screams. <i>You stop this right now</i>, he says, but his voice is
        weak and scared-sounding. Imogen throws a crystal soap dish at the wall,
        where it shatters. Kept_Male gently swats her thigh, and she smiles
        slightly. He turns her over his knee and smacks her on her diaper,
        harder this time. <i>You</i>’<i>re getting the hang of it</i>, Imogen
        says, blowing her nose on her bonnet. <i>I</i>’
        <i>ll need this dry cleaned</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kept_Male goes to bed early, pulling the blanket up over his head,
        wishing he could drown out the noise of Imogen’s laughter down below.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>I need a strong father figure</i>, Imogen tells them. <i>There</i>’
        <i>s nothing more disgusting than indecisive parental figures</i>.
        PhoneBaby glares at Kept_Male. <i>I</i>’
        <i>m not comfortable hitting babies</i>, he says, watching as Imogen
        chews on a couch cushion. <i>I</i>’<i>ll destroy this house</i>, Imogen
        says, her chubby cheeks shaking with rage. <i>You agreed to this</i>.{" "}
        <i>Don’t fuck it up</i>. PhoneBaby scoops her up, gently bouncing her up
        and down on her hip. <i>Daddy will get the hang of it</i>, she murmurs
        to Imogen. <i>Just give it a little time</i>. Imogen pouts, her pudgy
        lips blowing spit bubbles at Kept_Male.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imogen and PhoneBaby sign Kept_Male up for a class called Assertive
        Parenting for Father Figures 101. The class is at 11:00PM every Monday
        night and Kept_Male takes a cab to a lumbering brick building, stubby
        cigarette butts and Big Gulp cups draining red fluid on the steps. He
        knocks on the plastic window of the door and a thin man with long black
        braids and bleached eyebrows opens it. <i>Welcome</i>, <i>comrade</i>!
        he says, pulling Kept_Male in by the wrist. The other men turn their
        heads towards Kept_Male when he walks into the room where they are
        sitting cross-legged in a circle, pink plastic dolls lying at their
        feet. <i>Welcome</i>!!! <i>Hi Daddy</i>! <i>Ready 2 get 2 work</i>!? The
        fathers say, saluting and waving, inclining heads and stretching their
        hands out to him as he walks around the circle. The man with the long
        braids steps delicately into the center of the circle, pointing to the
        plastic doll that Kept_Male should sit with. <i>Daddies</i>,{" "}
        <i>welcome to Assertive Parenting for Father Figures</i>!{" "}
        <i>Our families want big</i>, <i>bold authoritarian figures</i>.{" "}
        <i>They want a MAN OF THE HOUSE</i>. <i>Are you</i>? He spins on one
        foot, slowly pointing at each man. The men stare at their plastic babies
        or their shoes, shaking their heads. <i>Not yet</i>. The man flips his
        braids behind his shoulders. <i>But you WILL BE</i>. <i>Men</i>,{" "}
        <i>my name is Randee</i>, <i>and I</i>’
        <i>
          ll be walking you through a program designed to teach you how to be
          the Father Figure of your family’s dreams
        </i>
        . Randee hands out a thick stack of paper to each man.{" "}
        <i>The four cornerstones of Fatherhood are Disciplinarian</i>,{" "}
        <i>Provider</i>, <i>Warrior and Lover</i>. The other men in the circle
        like this. They pound on their chests and grab their cocks, flexing
        their arms and slicking back their hair. <i>Let</i>’
        <i>s start with the big D</i>, Randee says, popping his knuckles.{" "}
        <i>
          Do you think your kids will respect you if all they can see in you is
          a little baby boy
        </i>
        ? The men in the group get riled up at this and shake their fists,
        slapping each other on the back. <i>HELL NO</i>!!! Randee squints his
        eyes at Kept_Male. <i>Release the boy</i>, he says, crouching in front
        of him. Kept_Male can see that one of Randee’s eyes is bright yellow,
        the other one almost a solid black.{" "}
        <i>RELEASE THE BOY AND THE MAN EMERGES</i>! Randee’s nose is pressing
        into Kept_Male’s, and the other men press in behind Randee, dogpiling
        Kept_Male, their mouths working frantically as they shout RELEASE THE
        BOY! RELEASE THE BOY! Kept_Male wonders what it will feel like to
        release the little baby boy that Randee is talking about. He thinks of a
        black door opening in his stomach, and a small figure peering out. The
        baby has massive cheeks and thinning hair swept to the side of its
        sweaty scalp. It drops to its knees and crawls out through the door,
        leaving sticky handprints behind. Kept_Male feels cold.{" "}
        <i>The baby is gone</i>, he says to the group of men on top of him.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kept_Male asks the cab driver to take him to PhoneBaby’s old condo. It’s
        almost 2AM, and he leans his head against the window, watching the
        throngs of bodies moving down the sidewalks, the whites of their eyes
        bright in the headlights, their long arms swinging around another’s
        shoulder, mouths opening to tell one another <i>I love you</i>,{" "}
        <i>I want to fuck you</i>,{" "}
        <i>I just want someone next to me so please don</i>’<i>t leave</i>. The
        cab pulls up to PhoneBaby’s place. The streetlights have been busted
        out, and the condo sits in dark angles. Someone’s spraypainted{" "}
        <i>SLOB MY KNOB</i> on the driveway. <i>Looks like a lot of work</i>,
        the cab driver says. Kept_Male picks up the broken glass from the
        streetlight. The exterior courtyard wall is crumbling, and he can see
        where someone’s taken a sledgehammer to it. Chucks of concrete and rebar
        litter the living room, and he picks up empty beer bottles, a used
        condom, a roll of toilet paper. He sits in PhoneBaby’s tub, which has
        black mold growing between the slabs of a glass brick wall she’s only
        partially finished. He lays his head against the cool porcelain and
        watches as dark clouds move across the roofless bathroom. He cries and
        thinks about Imogen and thinks <i>I hate you</i>. He thinks about Randee
        and the men and the plastic babies. He thinks about boys and father
        figures, and he tries to open the little black door in his stomach, but
        it doesn’t budge. He calls Phone_Baby, and Imogen answers.{" "}
        <i>Who is it</i>? He can hear PhoneBaby in the background. She sounds
        way older than twenty-one, he thinks. <i>Where are you</i>? Imogen asks.
        Her voice is slurred. <i>We</i>’<i>ve been drinking</i>,{" "}
        <i>me and mommy</i>. Kept_Male curls up in the bathtub with his
        cellphone propped between his ear and shoulder. He listens to Imogen and
        PhoneBaby laughing. He can hear ice jittering in his nice whiskey
        goblets. He can hear the record player playing Francoise Hardy. He can
        hear the waterfall, pouring down the side of the rocks, and he thinks of
        Imogen’s chunky limbs flailing, the water frothing over her lips and
        eyes, her bonnet floating to the surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kept_Male returns to Falling Water the next morning. The living room rug
        is stained with mixers and cigarette burns. PhoneBaby and Imogen are in
        the kitchen, PhoneBaby is gently sponging Imogen’s sticky cheeks with a
        paper towel. <i>Good morning</i>, Kept_Male says, trying to amplify his
        voice. He opens the fridge and catches a look pass between Imogen and
        PhoneBaby—eyebrows raised, lips pursed downwards.{" "}
        <i>Sorry about last night</i>, he says. <i>Men</i>’
        <i>s group ran late</i>. He fixes a plate of leftovers and takes it to
        the living room, where he sits down near an empty whiskey bottle. He
        stretches his arms in front of him and looks at his hands which have
        very long fingers. He looks out of the windows, out at the dense green
        light that comes into the house so gently it sometimes makes him cry. He
        thinks about being a Warrior, about being a Disciplinarian. He thinks
        about PhoneBaby21 floating in the Dead Sea, with its pocketed
        salt-ridged shoreline. PhoneBaby and Imogen come into the living room,
        their eyes sly and quiet.{" "}
        <i>We want to know where you were last night</i>, Imogen says, her voice
        overloud and angry. <i>Nowhere</i>, Kept_Male says, looking out at the
        Japanese maples he’d planted four years ago. He thinks he’ll change the
        seasons at Fallingwater. He’ll bring in a big freeze that will kill off
        the delicate stems of the maple trees, that will stick to the windows in
        an unforgiving frost. <i>I love you</i>, he says to PhoneBaby. She
        smiles at Imogen, who rolls her eyes.{" "}
        <i>We think it would be a good idea if you moved out</i>, Imogen says,
        puffing out her chest. Her stocky arms are planted at her sides, and her
        cheeks are still wet and sticky.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kept_Male does move out. He changes the weather at Fallingwater to
        winter, even though PhoneBaby begs him not to. Claude and Leena let him
        move in with them, but he’s exhausted by how often they want to have
        sex, and how shiny all their red leather furniture is. They have
        pictures of Imogen on the fridge and mantle place, where her puffy face
        watches him from an enameled frame while he sleeps on Leena’s pleather
        sofa. He drives to PhoneBaby’s old condo, and walks through its
        crumbling walls, shooing away a lackluster orgy. He lays down in the tub
        and cradles his face in his hands. He doesn’t love PhoneBaby anymore. He
        thinks about the little door inside his chest, the one that Imogen
        crawled out of. He tucks his chin in tight and shuts his eyes. There it
        is: a black door with a shiny brass handle. He wrenches it open.
