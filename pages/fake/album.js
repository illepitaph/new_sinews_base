        <br />
        The commute was subtly unpleasant, although there was no basis for
        complaint. The passengers more than behaved themselves, refraining from
        talking into their cell phones or, for that matter, to each other.
        Queuing and boarding was a thing of beauty. For all the emphasis on
        surfaces here, the vulnerability left for everyone to see in public
        spaces, sleeping on trains, on doorsteps, or in a cafe, could be viewed
        not as embarrassments of defeat, but celebrations of trust. Still, there
        was a weariness. One time he found himself sitting across from a young
        couple who were leaning into each other and giggling. Clearly they had
        been at it all morning. It was nothing outrageous, just a reminder that
        hardly anybody ever even smiled on the train.
        <br />
        <br />
        He learned to keep his feelings to himself as well. Sometimes he had his
        head buried in a book, using a jacket cover so as not to alert his
        fellow riders as to what he was reading, since it was not in Japanese
        and might draw attention and disturb them, but later on he learned the
        utility of just closing his eyes. So long as he did not open his mouth
        to speak, particularly when he was wearing a suit, he was one of them.
        This ability, if that was what it was, came into play here with more
        complex rules of engagement than he encountered back home. People even
        pegged him for Japanese in Taiwan, where he thought they should have
        seen through him without hearing his accent. Was he, somehow, Japanese?
        The atmosphere soaked into you. It became a part of you.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was not a long ride. He could make it door-to-door in fifty minutes.
        The precision of the trains made it possible to calculate his arrival
        time exactly. It took seven minutes to walk from the subway platform to
        his “mansion.” Coming home, it was up a gradual slope.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kanji on the sign, which he could understand but not at first
        pronounce, read, “fishing basket hill.” There was no river evident
        nearby, but in premodern times, before Tokyo Bay was filled, the waves
        of Shinagawa might have reached this far. Across from the subway station
        were a ramen shop, a French bakery, and a mom-and-pop home electronics
        store. It was a gray, quiet neighborhood with a profusion of temples.
        One of them had its gate guarded by a trio of red-bibbed jizo statues.
        Behind him, as he walked up the hill, was the very different,
        science-fictional spectacle of Mori Tower. The Japanese seemed to refer
        to it simply as “Roppongi Hills.” And although he could not perceive it
        directly, if he looked into the upper story windows of certain apartment
        buildings when the sun was shining, he saw the reflection of Tokyo
        Tower.
        <br />
        <br />
        Only seven minutes. But it felt long going uphill, encumbered by his
        dress shoes and handbag. It was the same, deliberate march of the other
        men he saw making their way up and down the slope.
        <br />
        <br />
        The lobby, which had a spiral staircase descending into the middle of
        it, was too dark and unadorned to convey the luxury that, he imagined,
        was intended. It was immaculate. At the security desk was one of a staff
        of senior men, who had a broad and open range of responsibilities. The
        old man recognized Horace by now and activated the automatic doors by
        pressing a button. He went by the spiral stairs up a level, crossed the
        outdoor courtyard, with its raked stones and plum trees in full blossom,
        and took the tower elevator to the fifth floor. The blossoms, hence the
        entire courtyard, smelled of—he tried to think of it—Kool-Aid.
        <br />
        <br />
        The apartment was on a dimly lit landing shared with only one other
        unit. The door required a bit of a shove. The sound of the television.
        Cartoon voices. He dropped his bag on the ground, took off his shoes,
        and loosened his tie. The apartment was spacious for Tokyo. One of the
        rooms had a tatami floor. The rest of the apartment was Western in
        style. Still, it was smaller than their two-bedroom in Los Angeles. It
        had taken a while for his kids to get used to it here.
        <br />
        <br />
        From the living room, through a sliding glass door, was a balcony where
        they hung the laundry, looking out toward the high rises of Shinagawa
        and the bay. Phoebe was in the kitchen. A little more than a year ago,
        she was on maternity leave. After the baby was born, she went back to
        work for three months, then got laid off, that most American of
        experiences. That presented the opportunity for them to go. In less than
        six months, she had gone from being a career woman, to pregnant, to laid
        off, to being a housewife in Japan.
        <br />
        <br />
        The two boys were in front of the television set. They were excited to
        see him, as always. The excitement seemed to be waning lately, though,
        as it was sinking in they were going to be here for a while. And the
        oldest boy, for good reason, was anxious. Horace took off his tie and
        jacket and went into the kitchen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Phoebe pointed to three opened liter milk cartons on the counter. They
        were long and thin in shape, the biggest carton size they could find.
        Given the amounts the boys drank, it was not unusual for them to go
        through two cartons a day.
        <br />
        <br />
        The kitchen was narrow too, where they felt the biggest squeeze. Back
        home, there was plenty of counter space. But here, there was barely
        enough to put down the cutting board, and the two of them, not large,
        could not pass each other without one of them backing up. But at least
        everything was in arm’s reach.
        <br />
        <br />
        He picked up a pair of scissors and started cutting. The sensation of
        pressing through the spongy cardboard with the dull scissors, and the
        cramp he felt in his hand, would become one of his most vivid memories
        of Japan. Maybe because he did it every fucking day. When Phoebe found
        out it was apartment regulations to rinse used milk cartons, cut them
        apart, and lay them flat before discarding them, she said, “You do it.
        There’s no way I’m cutting up milk cartons every day.”
        <br />
        <br />
        He took the elevator down. There were a lot of waste recycling and
        disposal rules. When he had first looked at the manual, piecing it
        together from his limited Japanese, the kanji and the katakana, he did
        not believe people really peeled the labels off water bottles, washed
        them, and separately disposed of the label, plastic cap, and PET bottle.
        When he first walked into the tidy recycling area, arranged in eight
        bins, he felt he had arrived at Tokyo’s heart of darkness. But of course
        it was only a gateway.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        It would be their first time to Kamakura. He had read{" "}
        <i>Thousand Cranes</i>. They were going to catch the end of the cherry
        blossoms. Every weekend they went somewhere new, and Tokyo in its
        infinity was big enough to allow for that. It was as if they were on an
        overseas vacation, if only on weekends. In between was the tedium, for
        him, of work, and for her, staying at home with the baby. As for big
        brother, it was waiting out the hours and the minutes at the school
        where he did not understand a word being said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Coming after central Tokyo for two months, Kita Kamakura was a shock. It
        resembled those rural train stops in Taiwan between Taipei and Keelung
        or in Nan-tou. Maybe a little neater. You exited onto a little platform,
        came down, and crossed the track. A mass of people came out of the train
        too, but soon dissolved into the hills. There were a lot of leaves on
        the trees. He was afraid they had missed the blossoms. The air was
        gentle. There was a hint of California and he was reminded they were
        just on the other side of the same sea.
        <br />
        <br />
        He could not remember where he had heard it before, the idea of one side
        of the Pacific as dream, the other reality. But which was reality and
        which dream? Or were you always the butterfly in the dream, dreaming of
        reality? Nothing applied here. All of that had been expected, though.
        What had not was that they were, the four of them, in it together. Apart
        from one another, but somehow together. Although who knew what baby was
        thinking. His next meal, probably. It would have been one thing if he
        had come alone. It probably would not have been much different from the
        two years he had spent in Taipei after college, when, now that he
        thought about it, he had met Phoebe. It made it many times harder to go
        through this with her and the kids. You observed your own reactions. You
        observed your wife and children go through the same.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was having a hard time. They did not have a clothes dryer. It was a
        culture of watching the weather and hanging your laundry out on the
        balcony.
        <br />
        <br />
        They walked on the path to central Kamakura. They popped into some of
        the larger, famous temples. Engakuji was the one in the Kawabata novel,
        right? It was a really long trek, through winding hills and some pretty
        narrow sidewalks that barely accommodated the American-sized stroller.
        <br />
        <br />
        The trees around Hachimangu were shedding their blossoms. It was fubuki,
        the snowstorm. The path was lined with pink petals, as if they had been
        arranged.
        <br />
        <br />
        They got unagi for lunch then headed over to the shrine. Baby got
        excited and ran wild on the open grounds. He and his brother chased the
        falling blossoms, grabbing piles of them and throwing them into the air.
        They were so happy they looked like they were other people. People
        watched them out of the corner of their eyes. A deep tiredness seemed to
        come over his wife, under the eaves.

        <br />
        There was a woman, Uehara, whom the reorganization had transferred off
        the team. No one knew where she had been placed. Was she working as an
        assistant for the department chief? One rumor had it she was moving to
        Atlanta, where her husband was studying.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whatever, that night, the team took her out to dinner as a sendoff.
        Horace joined, although he did not know her well. The eight of them took
        her to an izakaya, where everyone got pretty sauced over beer and
        shochu. From there, the night went on, over a deep selection of awamori.
        Ookawa, who was built like a lightweight sumo wrestler, seemed
        completely unfazed as the night went on.
        <br />
        <br />
        For weekday team bonding, it was a tame evening and ended early. Still,
        the awamori came down like a hammer. Uehara was draped over Horace by
        night’s end. The others elected him to carry her into a cab. Nakahira
        went with her to make sure she got home in one piece.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ookawa bought everybody little bottles of ukon from the 7-11. It was an
        herbal hangover cure you drank before you went to sleep. Horace doubted
        anything could be done about it, he did not put much stock into folk
        remedies, but he thanked his boss and got an explanation on how to use
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The group dispersed on the street corner in the abrupt Tokyo manner.
        They figured out who was going where, and those heading in the same
        direction cleaved off by bowing and melting into the city. Horace was
        left on his own. Through the closing window of his drunkenness, he tried
        to figure out what part of town he was in and which train line to take.
        <br />
        <br />
        He had been through worse. There was the night, coming back from
        Shinjuku from his “initiation,” when he had somehow made it home via
        multiple transfers without remembering any of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The long, pristine, and evacuated midtown blocks. One aspect of Tokyo’s
        beauty was the celerity of its population’s movements. Suddenly you were
        in a teeming mass of humanity, crowds unlike anywhere else in the world.
        Then the same would be as deserted and as sterile as a suburban office
        park, with everyone gone off to fill the interiors of those charmless
        high rises. Life, in its unpredictability, took place inside those
        structures. In vertical space. The streets, the train stops, the trains
        themselves were nothing but theatrical stages.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the train the woman sitting next to him attempted to take off her
        jacket, probably responding to the humidity in the car, made worse by
        the dripping umbrellas, shoes, and coats. Because the jacket was also
        slick with rain, she tried not to get him wet with any sudden activity,
        which painfully drew out her movements. She withdrew her arm from its
        sleeve. He could only see suggestions in the corner of his peripheral
        vision. He felt more coherently her motion, erotic in that homely way
        that struck him as a distinct Japanese taste.
        <br />
        <br />
        At home, having fought his way up the slope in the strengthening rain,
        he was met at his front door with a note, probably from the concierge,
        in language that went beyond polite, requesting the next time he bring
        his wet umbrella indoors to dry off, instead of leaving it on the
        landing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Phoebe was still up, waiting for the laundry to dry. For some reason, it
        had been hard to sleep since they arrived in Japan. In California they
        went to bed early as couples with young children do, but here they
        stayed up all hours. Was it the crowds and pollution? The otherwise
        unheard hum of the city? Magnetic fields or the position on the earth?
        <br />
        <br />
        The rain fell, unceasingly, against the window. Most of the high rises
        around them had their lights off. She kicked her feet up on the chair.
        Horace came in, at the opposite end of the long corridor, steps heavy
        against spongy hardwood. The kids were asleep. It was the quietest time
        of day.
        <br />
        <br />
        He took off his rain-spattered jacket and loosened his tie and sat at
        the adjacent corner of the dining table, where they always had their
        conversations now.
        <br />
        <br />
        “I thought today it’d be a good idea to pack him a carton of milk with
        his lunch. But when lunch started, the teacher took the milk away,
        didn’t give it back, and said he should drink tea like the other kids.
        Tea! He told the teacher he didn’t drink tea, so she gave him warm water
        instead.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “It’s probably one of those Japanese conformity things. If someone
        starts drinking milk, then someone else might want to bring milk to
        school too, then what’s the world coming to?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Another thing. I’ve been packing him sandwiches but today he said he
        wants bento boxes for lunch. I know he likes sandwiches. But he said the
        other kids think it’s funny he’s eating sandwiches instead of from a
        bento box. We don’t want him any more singled out than he already feels.
        Maybe I should start making him a bento box. But it’s easier to make a
        sandwich than a bento box. And I’m not even talking about the whole
        ‘competitive bento box’ thing.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Look, these kids need to open their eyes and learn a little about
        diversity. We come from a foreign culture. What if he gets used to
        eating bento boxes? Then he’s going to go back to America and not want
        to eat sandwiches anymore and eat bento boxes. He’ll be a laughingstock.
        I’ve already made up my mind.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “We can try again tomorrow, but if he’s still uncomfortable with it, I
        think we should switch.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “It’ll be a good experience for him to assert his will against the
        herd.”
        <br />
        <br />
        She looked up out the wet glass. A sock was floating in a pool of water.
        She got up and came back with their laptop computer.

        <br />
        “Before you forget, show me how to check the weather. It’s impossible to
        do laundry in this country without a good weather forecast. I need one
        that goes by the hour. The English sites are useless.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You’re right. The Japanese sites are a hundred percent. I don’t know
        how they do it.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “This fucking season. I put a load of laundry out this afternoon and
        everything got drenched. It’s depressing. Doesn’t anyone use a dryer in
        this country? Is it because every woman’s expected to hang laundry? When
        I was bringing in the wet clothes, there was a woman over at the
        building next door looking at me like I was an idiot. Show me how to use
        the site.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Can this wait? Japanese sites are hard to navigate. They have a
        different design aesthetic. Everything’s a brain teaser. I’ll show you
        tomorrow.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’ve got laundry to do every day. I need to know the few hours it
        clears out tomorrow, otherwise we’re going to have soaked clothes piling
        up around the house for days.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Where’s the laundry now?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “In the bathroom. It’s so damp in there, it doesn’t help.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I need to take a shower.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Take the clothes out and put them back when you’re done.” She peered
        outside. The moonlight was refracted through hundreds of gemlike
        raindrops. “No point hanging them outside now.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Look, I just need to sleep a little at least. I’ve got a three a.m. and
        another ten a.m. call.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You can’t tell them to leave you alone? What’s the point of sending you
        out here if you’re on the phone with them every night?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Look, it can’t be helped.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I know. They think we’re here on some kind of sabbatical. A family
        vacation. It’s anything but. If this keeps up … I don’t know how much
        longer I can hold out. Every day I remember why I wanted to get out of
        Asia.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’m on assignment. It’s not like I can roll it back on my own, after
        all the trouble the company took getting us here.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Tell them I’m fed up. We’re making sacrifices here to make things work,
        so you can experience working in Japan. It’s not just me. Your children!
        They don’t see you anymore at night. You’re always coming home late …
        They hate you. Just like a salaryman. Tell them that’s okay. That’s what
        we signed up for. But these phone calls ... It’s got to stop. You’ve got
        to sleep at least. And if they can’t cut it out, then I’m going to tell
        them myself we’re going home.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Phoebe was right, of course. It would be a relief to get the troubles in
        Los Angeles off his mind, even if it meant abandoning his colleagues to
        their fate. What was his obligation to them? They were just his
        co-workers.
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’ve already said I’d take this call tonight, but this will be the last
        one. I’ll send Ryo an email first thing in the morning.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Good. Now show me how to use this weather site.”
        <br />
        <br />
        In the end, Phoebe decided not to make their son a sandwich. She did not
        have time to prepare a bento box, though. She told Horace to stop by the
        onigiri shop, which was advantageously positioned at the end of the
        alley, at the intersection with the main road facing the school. It was
        barely a window, run by an old couple. The wife, wearing an apron and
        rag on her head, took the order while her husband made rice balls by
        hand. It was the last resort employed by other parents. The onigiri was
        discreetly packaged in unmarked wrapping, so it did not look like you
        had bought it at a convenience store.
        <br />
        <br />
        He asked his kid if he knew how to eat one.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes, he said, he traded his sandwich for one yesterday.
        <br />

        Every day he either ate at his desk or went out with his co-workers for
        lunch. The conversations kept coming back to the same questions, about
        was he getting used to Japan yet. Now that the rain had finally stopped,
        though, he wanted to take a look outside, alone. It had suddenly turned
        hot. The rain turned into steam. He kept to the back alleys because they
        were in the shade and also because it was easy to get lost in there. Not
        that he could not find his way back, although he figured the mazes were
        deep enough it would take him weeks, with these short breaks, to really
        get to know them. But he wanted to get lost in the other sense, of
        himself being the thing lost, of becoming anonymous, which was different
        than being invisible. Invisibility was something imposed upon you.
        Anonymity had to be worked at.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each shop contained no more than two aisles. The shelves ran out along
        exterior walls, so people were browsing on the sidewalk and in the
        alleys. The goal did not seem so much to sell, since the appeal was
        limited to only a few obsessives anyway, as to organize with nostalgia
        in mind: with space so limited, each shelf was impeccably curated. The
        importance of the books lay not so much in what was in them as in what
        had happened around them, in the lives of their former owners. He came
        across a collection of Katue Kitasono’s, Pound’s old buddy. So
        apparently he actually existed. Shiro no arubumu. Is that where the
        White Album came from? Did Yoko know about it? He found Malevich and
        Picabia monographs next to maps of old Edo. He made his way up the
        wooden stairs, posters on either side of him, to what was more of a
        gallery than a bookstore, with framed prints for sale. In one corner, in
        a glass case that was like looking into a diorama, he saw some black and
        white photos that seemed to be film stills. Next to them was a letter,
        in English, on ruled paper written in pretty cursive like a young
        girl’s. To the recipient, who lived in Colorado, it said, “I have also
        enclosed some photographs of an authentic harakiri ceremony, which I
        hope you find interesting.” Signed, Yukio Mishima.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now he was in a café with high-end speakers on either side of the bar.
        Behind the counter were shelves lined with spine-out LPs and bottles of
        gin and whiskey. The bass line hit like blocks of concrete. Too loud to
        talk, but that was not the point. He had come in for iced coffee, but
        everyone else, all of them lone men in their fifties, was sitting facing
        the speakers. What was the tune? He was not a head, like them. The LP
        was thoughtfully displayed face out: Stanley Turrentine’s <i>Up at </i>‘
        <i>Minton</i>’<i>s</i>’. He was now some four months into this
        experiment. Words to explain were hard to find. Anxieties clustered in
        the start-and-stop of tightening and release. Why did even he feel the
        tentacles of Tokyo society? He had to be careful not to let the
        seemingly unresolvable frustrations of the job (the one in California,
        not the one here) color his perception of Japan or the Japanese, or let
        that bleed over to his co-workers. Otherwise you stopped seeing them as
        human beings, as in a war. Which would be unprofessional.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Once they heard he had never been to a matsuri, his co-workers were
        determined to take him.
        <br />
        <br />
        There would be some “ero-grotesque” surprises in store, they promised.
        At Yasukuni Shrine, as it turned out. He knew what was there, just did
        not know it was so close by. So were they talking about the kamikaze
        stuff? No. His co-workers did not seem to think anything about that. To
        them there was nothing to the place other than that it was where to go
        this time of year for Mitama. The only hint of controversy, as they
        ascended the mild grade past Budokan, was a lone protestor squatting at
        the base of a tree, decrying former Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui’s
        brother for being inside, which, as Horace thought of it, was less of a
        shot at Japanese militarism than an attempt to discredit Taiwanese
        autonomy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The long walking path past the first torii gate had been lined with
        thousands of yellow lanterns, bobbing in the pleasant summer night. The
        lanterns and booths, whose gaudiness contrasted with the gray politeness
        of the office, created a disorienting effect and obscured almost
        completely the shrine itself. It came through in hints, looming behind
        the festival glow in the shadows of eaves and old pines. The sound of
        the crowd, interwoven with the stylized patter of the booth hawkers,
        felt as if it were emanating from the grounds themselves. He ate
        skewered ayu and yakisoba from a flimsy paper plate. Somewhat against
        his will, he played the game with the paper scooper where you got a
        goldfish in a plastic bag. He walked around with the fish the rest of
        the night. Past the second gate and the Shinmon, the festival turned
        into a cloud of colors and smoke. In front of the main hall, as somewhat
        of a prank put on him by his co-workers, he joined the bon odori in the
        plaza, clapping his hands and moving in a halting rhythm with other
        dancers, welcoming back the dead to the world of the living.
        <br />
        <br />
        They went to the freak tent. A scruffy-looking girl (or child-sized
        woman) in a yukata stood on a box jabbering musically at the hypnotized
        crowd while her colleagues extracted bills from them. From the painted
        images, it was obvious the Snake Woman was the main attraction, although
        several other curiosities were advertised. At one point, from a balcony
        above the entrance, the Snake Woman, in white robe, hair long and
        straight, face pale and lips blood red, made a teasing appearance with
        one of her pets held outstretched between her fingers. Then she
        vanished.
        <br />
        <br />
        They waited for the room to clear out the exit on the other side before
        being let into the tent. He could not pick a spot. The crowd simply
        pushed him around until it stopped. The ground was sloped, so he could
        see above the heads in front of him. It was hard to breathe. At some
        point, when the room was sufficiently packed, the doors closed, and the
        stage became a tumbling series of skits involving fire and off-color
        jokes before the Snake Woman, waiting until the situation had just about
        become intolerable, emerged. Her snakes, black and rubbery, moved in and
        out of her fingers, and mouth, before, with somewhat less ritual than he
        had been expecting, she bit into one, ripping it in half and spraying
        blood into the crowd. She swallowed its parts. The closing image of the
        night, as they were shuffled out to make way for the next group, was the
        lower portion of her face, drenched in blood.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        There were expat markets in Hiroo and Azabu. They told themselves it was
        for the kids, having even made it out to Disneyland twice just for the
        buffet, when in fact the boys were taking to a Japanese diet faster than
        they did. By midsummer they had stopped going to family restaurants.
        Instead: fish, rice, tea, the muted palette from which the entire
        Japanese world was born. No surprise the traditional seasonal
        ingredients, squid and eggplant in summer, were the best bets to add
        some variation. That purity was elementary once you grasped it, but
        seemed like a great revelation; the diet rooted you to the soil.
        <br />
        <br />
        She ventured further out. It was hot, but a relief to be able to explore
        with no rain. She was still pushing the stroller, but now she did not
        have to put that awkward plastic covering on to keep baby dry. He could
        breathe. One of the tricks she learned was taking the side alleys
        through which she could maneuver the bulky stroller. Along the larger
        avenues, although they were easier to navigate, she was always dodging,
        or running into, pedestrians and bicycles on the narrow sidewalks, and
        she had to stay wary of the car traffic speeding by only a few inches
        off the curb. But the side alleys were quiet, especially by midmorning.
        She could walk in the middle of the street and her mind could wander.
        <br />
        <br />
        She had been taking Meiji-dori under the expressway to Hiroo, which took
        about an hour one-way. But now she had found another route, deep off the
        main intersection, through a street of old shops, one of those hidden
        behind layers of development, layers that did not sprawl outward, but,
        like much of Tokyo, spiraled inward. In doing so she stumbled across a
        lost continent. There seemed to be only locals, meaning the immediate
        neighborhood, who frequented it. Someone had come up with the idea of
        playing oldies from loudspeakers strung up on street lamps. The effect
        was to lend the old shops even more melancholy than they already had.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hiroo by contrast was stylish. It was popular with expats and Japanese
        used to life abroad, which, even in Tokyo, connoted something luxurious.
        In other words, it was the neighborhood where you could buy bread,
        cheese, steak, and wine. Even though looking around there was not much
        that looked especially “Western,” it went beyond wealth. The more
        traditionally well off neighborhoods she had been to. You felt a deep
        reserve there. Here were convertibles. She had taken to coming here the
        first few months when she was feeling homesick, or just needed some
        relief from the confinement of the apartment, but lately she had been
        going less.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instead of north and west toward Hiroo and Roppongi, she began to check
        out the neighborhood at the bottom of the grade that headed northeast.
        Eventually it merged with Sakurada-dori. Over this wide thoroughfare,
        due north, stood Tokyo Tower. Because the street ended at its base, it
        was the most unobstructed view of the tower in the city. She never
        walked that far, though. The furthest she got with the baby was the
        entrance to Keio University and the alleys populated by students around
        it. Most of the time she browsed the drugstore, teaching herself
        Japanese cosmetics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Baby and stroller became a voyager, pulling her instead of the other way
        around. The spongy grip on the handle, training muscles in the wrists
        and hands. The wheels hugging Tokyo’s uneven pavement. The stilling of
        momentum when she threw on the brake. Keeping her ears out for baby’s
        gurgling messages. Once she started taking the subway, worlds awaited,
        although she was still limited to lines and stations that provided
        convenient enough elevator access. That was because she was not allowed
        by regulation to take the stroller on the escalator, and there was no
        way she was going to carry it up and down stairs.
        <br />
        <br />
        July provided the excuse to go to Harajuku, for the semiannual clearance
        sales. Getting there required two transfers, but the stations were
        relatively easy to get around in, and there was a new and spacious
        elevator at Omotesando. She never bought much clothes in America, but
        here they were made for her body. She knew fabrics. Part of her mother’s
        side of the family was in the textile business, and she had spent a few
        summers working for them. Now in the sale racks she developed an
        appreciation for the typically fine Japanese attention to line and cut
        in even the cheapest clothes. She had been losing weight since arriving
        in Japan, a combination of diet and lack of sleep.
        <br />
        <br />
        Charcoal cleansers, collagen masks, and BB whiteners brightened the tone
        and sheen of her face. Her hair blackened from eating black sesame
        seeds. Her clothes began to fit. For the first time since college, she
        wore dresses. She blossomed. With her newfound feminine air, she finally
        began to blend in with the women around her.
        <br />
        <br />
        By two she made it back to pick up her other son from school. It had not
        occurred to her before, for some reason, but she thought she had better
        take some pictures of her children. They posed in the schoolyard, in the
        small dirt-lot playground on the walk home, in front of one of the
        temple gates, and in their own apartment, where they were most free. She
        dressed them up in summer yukata. When she took them out, the other
        parents thought it was so charming, maybe because they would not send
        out their own kids in public that way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her oldest son had gone silent for the first month or so after going to
        school. She knew, because the teacher had told Horace. He did not talk
        in class. Well, how could he? But he did not talk much when he came
        home, either. Just shrugged when she asked him how was his day. He had
        always been an outgoing kid, so she was afraid she was traumatizing him.
        But around the beginning of summer, he changed. Not just talking, but
        streams of Japanese. At first it was to his friends only, with whom he
        had been speaking until then in that universal kids’ language. But then
        it was to adults too, and he spoke it naturally with no accent. At home
        he even started watching NHK and sentai shows. He put on puppet shows in
        Japanese for his brother.
        <br />
        <br />
        So she was the only one still having a tough time, even though she was,
        she thought, making the best of it. She continued to keep her distance
        from the other mothers. You could guess what kind of scene that was.
        There was a woman who had spent some years in Australia and a Filipino
        woman who could speak English. She avoided them.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was more important, somehow, first to understand the messages being
        sent to her in shops, on websites, in advertising in subway cars and
        stations, and on television. That is, to be a consumer. This included
        not only what was being said but what was behind it. Somehow it made her
        feel more human. Of course it helped she could read kanji. Although she
        could not speak, they did not regard her as a total foreigner for this.
        <br />
        <br />
        What would happen to them when they returned? Neither she nor Horace
        thought about it. In his case, it was a little clearer. In hers, the
        entire trajectory of her working life over the past ten years had been
        truncated. She was still collecting unemployment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything she did not like about Taiwan was somehow worse here. There
        was the smallness of minds, the pretension, the insufferableness of the
        men, the pettiness of the women. Being the mother of a small child and a
        housewife was a peculiar and devious kind of death sentence here. Her
        health was probably suffering. Just as she had growing up, she had odd
        pains here and there, and she never got a good night’s sleep. It may
        have also been ghosts, the kind that belonged to East Asia, especially
        during the summer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet she could not say she disliked it. She found herself thinking of her
        father and the time he spent as a college student in Japan. She stalked
        his spirit and sentimentally felt closer to him for it. She was reminded
        she should visit her sister in Osaka. It was assumed she would, when the
        timing worked out, but she realized now it was no small matter to get to
        Kansai. Somehow in Tokyo you never thought of it. It was only on the
        subway, where the travel agencies and local tourism boards beckoned with
        this or that escape. Mount Takao. Kawagoe. Nikko. Miura. Matsumoto.
        Kumamoto. Okinawa. In her darker moods, especially those first few
        months, she had thought of bringing the kids with her to live with her
        mother in Taiwan, or with her sister in Kansai. At least now she could
        say she did not think about that anymore.

        <br />
        <br />
        One morning, with the decorum and alacrity with which everything was
        done here, it was autumn. Beyond the sudden snap to the air, the store
        displays, as if pulling a curtain, moved on to themes of colored leaves
        and seasonal produce and fish. For Horace, there was an element of
        nostalgia, in the underlying smoke in the air that reminded him of New
        England.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the first time he could remember, they were battling neither cold
        nor rain nor heat on the morning walks to school. Maybe because of that,
        the boy walked with more bounce, chatting about his friends and
        teachers, whom he never talked about before. Maybe it was just because
        he was getting better at Japanese, and they were treating him like one
        of them finally.
        <br />
        They took shortcuts now, instead of going along the main street. They
        cut into a side alley, by a post office, and through an old shrine gate
        from Edo. The remains of a greater gate, painted vermillion, with a
        tiled roof, rested in a field amid the modern mansions and narrow family
        houses.
        <br />
        <br />
        He let the boy walk at his own pace, while he stayed behind. What struck
        him, but of course this would be the case, was that the boy did not
        march off to school in a straight line, but wound around, taking his
        sweet time. He would get distracted by a weed or a bug or a song.
        <br />
        <br />
        They were brought up to the school entrance foyer to the step where the
        boy took off his shoes and changed into his white sneakers. He had
        traded in his summer straw boater for a felt bowler. It was getting just
        cold enough in the mornings that Horace thought about putting a coat
        over the boy’s uniform jacket. Now the boy did not hang around anymore.
        He ran straight off to class without saying goodbye.
        <br />
        <br />
        The principal caught him. He gave a deep bow. As far as he could tell,
        he was the only adult man around. He took off his shoes and left them at
        the step, pointed toward the door, and put on a pair of slippers. She
        went to her desk. His son had been given a role in the school play. A
        prominent role, some kind of animal, which meant he did not have
        speaking lines. But she meant the boy was coming along well. She also
        said in a couple of weeks there was going to be a Sunday family event, a
        curry cookoff, and both mothers and fathers should come. She placed some
        emphasis on this last point. Then she handed him a flier.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the hall he could hear the teacher playing a stirring piano tune and
        singing along with the children with real gusto. It struck him what they
        asked these kindergarten teachers to do. They were all young women,
        every one with a certain something to them. Big-sisterly was the best he
        could put it. Piano and carrying a tune on a long list of requirements,
        in addition to arts and crafts and keeping order among the children,
        which they seemed preternaturally adept at doing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe because he no longer felt as if he were leaving the boy to a
        potentially cruel fate, he went off to work more lighthearted too,
        moving through the residential back alleys that saw the least traffic.
        <br />
        <br />
        Baby was getting longer. At first he thought it was just he was getting
        thinner. Unlike the older boy, he had not taken to the diet of fish and
        rice. He ate—just enough. Nonetheless, clearly he was growing. There
        were the clothes, hand-me-downs, that were just right for him now. His
        arms and legs were getting firmer. Horace told Phoebe to stop taking the
        stroller. Make him walk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Without the stroller, their habits touring the city changed. No longer
        confined only to those places that afforded them a wide berth, parks or
        malls or places otherwise underpopulated, they could go more or less
        where other people went. Certain train lines became newly accessible. It
        was a revelation, for instance, how close Ginza was. They had taken a
        roundabout path before, because they could not use stations that only
        had stairs. But now baby was not only navigating steps pretty well, but
        hills too. Where they would have only gone to Ginza on Sunday, when they
        closed Chuo-dori to traffic, now they could have an early dinner on a
        weekday, if he got home early enough, something he was doing more
        frequently, and take off for an evening stroll among Tokyo’s most
        storied shopping blocks and still make it back in time for bath and
        bedtime. It seemed like a great luxury, and they suddenly felt like
        civilized people, living in this, the world’s most civilized city.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Even where the leaves had not changed were signs of the season, such as
        the sugidama, cedar balls, hanging outside saké shops; bound and tied
        (plastic) Shanghai crab in the windows of Chinese restaurants; plastic
        leaves tied to streetlights; and people wearing fall fashions still too
        warm for the weather. There were natural signs too, such as the one the
        older boy found so exciting, the dried husk of a cicada on the sidewalk.
        This is what they looked like? Like robot armor? And its negative
        complement: the silence in the trees. All conspired in a way that did
        not feel so much like coercion, towards purchases or production, as
        instruction. For the behavior asked for was strangely useless. It was an
        awareness of the breaking of the rhythm of everyday pursuits, that is,
        of time passing. Remembrances of what one was doing this time last year.
        Allowing a breath to be taken. In this sense it was even more insidious
        than mere advertising, not so much about control than propriety, not one{" "}
        <i>must</i>, but one <i>should</i>. “In order to gain a better
        appreciation …”
        <br />
        <br />
        They were in Yoyogi Park on the weekend. Horace had brought the boys
        here, with Phoebe taking her time at Harajuku Crossing. She joined them
        later, not long after they found their way past the rockabilly greasers.
        The boys zigzagged on the grass. The dull thud of a trance festival came
        over the row of trees to their left. It was almost dusk. It had been
        mild, a perfect day, days which only came in the short window of this
        time of year, but with the sun going down, the air took on a chill, and
        he was afraid they were not dressed for it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sunlight cut through the trees. A desert glow. Cold. Crows hopped out of
        the trees in ominously larger and larger congregations. Then he began to
        notice people laying blankets on the grass as they put on scarves and
        warmer clothes. Some of them broke out bottles of beer. Was the festival
        moving here for the night? But the people on the grass were older men
        and women, some with children.
        <br />
        <br />
        A crow was going through somebody’s backpack.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Look up.”
        <br />
        <br />
        The full moon was bright and clear.
        <br />
        <br />
        He had forgotten it was the Mid-Autumn Festival. He did not know they
        celebrated it in Japan too, or how.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Too bad we don’t have any moon cakes,” Phoebe said. The Chinese custom
        was to sit out on a clear autumn night and take in the moonlight. Eat
        cakes and recite poetry.
        <br />
        <br />
        “We could go to Yokohama. They sell them there year round.” It was a
        kind of joke between them they did that.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        “Shinjuku 3-chome, in front of Isetan.”
        <br />
        <br />
        It was Ryo. Horace did not know he was in town.
        <br />
        <br />
        No further explanation, so Horace told Phoebe his boss was calling to
        meet him on a street corner in Shinjuku at ten o’clock on a weeknight.
        At least the kids were already put to bed.
        <br />
        <br />
        When he got there, by subway, Ryo was already on the corner, alone. The
        department store’s doors were closed, although its Gothic lamps were
        still on. The older man was wearing a scarf and overcoat. Instead of
        motioning Horace to follow him somewhere, he stood his ground. He
        explained they would wait here for a few more people to show up.
        <br />
        <br />
        A minute later, a tall and very pretty woman, wearing a leather jacket
        and boots, walked up to their spot on the corner. She had had her hair
        waved and was wearing it loose. Dark complexion. Looked maybe to be in
        her twenties. Ryo only introduced her by name, Misa. They seemed to
        regard each other coldly and kept their distance from each other while
        both of them smoked.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apparently Ryo was somewhat buzzed and slurred, “When the others get
        here and ask you who she is, just tell them she’s my cousin, from
        Nagoya.”
        <br />
        <br />
        No need for outright deception, Horace thought. Everyone would see right
        through it anyway, so maybe it was more of a case of politeness? Who
        knew about these things?
        <br />
        <br />
        Ryo placed a call on his cell. About five minutes later, three men
        arrived, one older, two younger. The older one, with metal glasses and a
        few strands of hair on top of his head, was Shimamura. He was already
        fairly blasted. Red in the face, stumbling over his steps. The younger
        men, in suits like him, had to hold him up. They were junior financial
        directors who reported to him. Horace had been told Shimamura was the
        only one who had a full picture, and for that matter, any concrete
        understanding, of the situation of the overseas branch. For that reason,
        he was the only one in the organization who had any real authority to
        decide on their standing. It was a vital relationship for Ryo. On the
        other hand, it was just one of several he juggled and, to some likely
        extent, played against one another.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shimamura, who seemed to recognize Horace in his daze, came right at
        him, ignoring Ryo and his guest, and almost fell on top of him.
        Long-limbed, built like a basketball player, he put all his weight onto
        Horace’s right shoulder. Then a stream of gibberish filled one ear,
        which Horace, despite his improving language, could only guess was
        Japanese.
        <br />
        <br />
        The group moved north. Nobody asked about Misa. Yasukuni-dori was lit
        up. The finance executive attached himself to Horace and kept on
        babbling.
        <br />
        <br />
        They crossed at the intersection with Meiji-dori. It was crowded with
        matsuri booths and pushcarts. Tucked half a block down Meiji-dori was
        the entrance to Hanazono Shrine, mobbed by people both trying to leave
        and enter under a massive gate of paper lanterns. Squads of taxis parked
        out front waited to cart off drunks.
        <br />
        <br />
        They made their way past the tightly arranged booths with men and women
        in yukata selling traditional crafts. Ryo told Horace he would explain
        later what they were. There were also ones featuring games like the
        goldfish one he had played in the summer. They moved to the cordoned
        food area and found a table that would seat all six of them. It was a
        cold night, so that meant oden. Shimamura ordered three bottles of saké.
        Horace tried making some conversation with Misa.
        <br />
        <br />
        “You’re from Nagoya?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You live in Tokyo now?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah. I just moved here, for school. My first year in school, though, I
        lived in Nagoya.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You took the train every day?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Once a week. It was a pain.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “How do you like Tokyo?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Compared to Nagoya?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yeah.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “A lot better.”
        <br />
        <br />
        The oden and the saké warmed them up thoroughly. Then they all went off
        to see the freak show. It was the same show Horace had seen in the
        summer, culminating with the Snake Woman. Same woman. Horace had to
        admit the effect was largely lost the second time around. Ryo and the
        others seemed to feel the same way, as it was probably old hat to them.
        There was no expression or comment from any of them as they shuffled out
        of the tent.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shimamura took his team for another round of drinks, while Ryo pulled
        Horace and Misa aside. He led them down one of the wide aisles selling
        what appeared to be gaudily decorated bouquets or wreaths, wrapped in
        clear plastic. Ryo stared contemplatively at each booth’s offerings.
        Misa kept her head down, hands in pockets. On closer look, it seemed to
        Horace they were not wreaths but decorated rakes.
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact that was what they were. Kumade, or “bear claws,” for clawing,
        or raking, in money. Most of the people buying them were businessmen,
        like themselves. Every year you bought one for success. More than that,
        if your sales were going to grow at all that year, you bought one bigger
        than the year before. That was why they came in all sizes. If it was
        your first time, you started small, so you did not end up buying too big
        of one too soon and maxing out. Ryo had gotten one every year except
        last year, because he could not make it back to Japan in time. It was
        this, more than anything, to which he attributed the disastrous
        financial results they had just posted.
        <br />
        <br />
        That was why, Ryo explained, Horace was being recalled to the States.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once he settled on something he liked, Misa became a lot more animated,
        chatting and laughing with the vendor, using a completely different way
        of speaking and looking suddenly a lot more at ease. Probably a dialect
        she used with a fellow Nagoyite. The kumade was massive. Its pieces,
        which included rice stalks and an otafuku mask, were stapled and glued
        to a thick bamboo culm. It stood as tall as Horace’s shoulders. Ryo
        explained he was going to have the vendor deliver it to Horace’s office.
        From here, it was Horace’s task to figure out how to get it back to Los
        Angeles.
        <br />
        <br />
        “That’s your job now. It’s a very important one.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Horace could not think of a solution for the moment, except to buy an
        airplane seat for the thing.
        <br />
        <br />
        The four of them, including the vendor, stood in a circle in front of
        the booth, made a rapid chant, wishing for good business next year, and
        clapped in time between chants. They all bowed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just as all three of them turned around, Shimamura and his two cronies
        came shambling back up to them. Shimamura tripped over a rock and one of
        the junior directors reached out to grab him before he crashed to the
        ground.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ryo gave the junior director a look, as if to ask, “Is he all right?”
        The younger man returned the look and shook his head.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Here.” Ryo pointed at Horace’s back.
        <br />
        <br />
        They dragged the executive over. Horace slung him over his shoulders
        like a jacket. “Put him in a taxi. Gogami-san will tell the driver where
        to go. See you next time.” With that, he walked off with Misa, into the
        lights and noise of the festival.
        <br />
        <br />
        Horace dragged Shimamura to the gate, which was twice as mobbed as it
        had been when they arrived. Nobody gave them a second glance. They
        managed to hail a taxi, and he dropped Shimamura inside, who was still
        gone to the world. Horace adjusted the glasses on his face, but could
        not quite get them right. Gogami shouted some directions at the driver.
        The door shut of its own accord. Gogami gave a curt goodbye, leaving
        Horace alone in the night. It was too late to catch a train.

        Phoebe had been sick since new year’s day, but she seemed to get over
        her illness after they boarded the bullet train at Shinagawa. She
        stopped coughing as soon as they got past Mount Fuji. It was the first
        time any of them had ever seen it. It is little understood how hard it
        is to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji from central Tokyo if not spending a
        lot of time in the upper floors of skyscrapers. It probably should not
        have come as a surprise that she recovered instantly. Whatever had been
        plaguing her in Tokyo had not followed her out of it. While they were
        concerned when they headed back, she did not suffer a relapse. The
        spirit did not return.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back in Tokyo, temple roofs were white with snow. Tokyo Tower was half
        obscured in freezing rain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Plum blossoms were starting to break. In Chinese aesthetics, they were
        the more prized flower over cherry blossoms, for blooming in the wastes
        of early spring. There was a stark beauty to them, in the courtyard, the
        parks, buds on branches reaching over compound walls. The best place to
        see them near their mansion was a public playground two blocks away. It
        was interesting to Horace for its bizarre displays explaining the
        prehistory of the district. There was even a lifesize diorama of a
        neolithic hut, with mannequins. The plum garden was in bloom, very
        precisely, as if by design. Each blossom the same proportion. After the
        rain, their sugary-sweet smell drifted out the park into the street.

        They had shipped off everything that could be shipped and moved out of
        their apartment.
        <br />
        <br />
        They had to stay in a hotel. The plan was to get brunch in the morning
        and head out from the station for Narita by noon.
        <br />
        <br />
        They opened a bottle of pink champagne. It seemed a very Tokyo drink,
        somehow. The kids were watching, and to some degree comprehending, a
        food show on TV.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was warm enough to stand out on the balcony. Earlier that day they
        had taken a stroll through the hotel gardens. Camellias were in bloom,
        and there was the very first hint of cherry buds.
        <br />
        <br />
        From the balcony, Tokyo stretched before them. Red warning beacons
        marked off the heights of that incomparable skyline. The moving lights
        of trains and planes. To their left were the towers of Shinjuku. Right
        in front of them, the core. Mori Tower. Tokyo Tower in orange hues. A
        dark sea in the middle that was the Imperial Palace. On their right, the
        Rainbow Bridge and the lights of Shiodome, Odaiba and, closer in,
        Shinagawa.

        Of all things, it was the ending of <i>Père Goriot</i> that came to him.
        Maybe it was the champagne. Rastignac standing on that hill in
        Père-Lachaise, looking over Paris. It occurred to him, he did not know
        what lay ahead, but probably he would be back before long. But that
        would be for meetings and presentations, as a business traveler. It
        would not be anything like this.
