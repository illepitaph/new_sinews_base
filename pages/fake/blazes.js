I looked at found
Thought does not arrive in a sentence 
A Tesla does! Its sentence of riches
Pollutes us
And light on the palms, my palms typing 
Big blue bus big blue in moms 
Los Angeles not where the movies are but burned up burning trashed 
woman fake farting by the pier 
she was exaggeratedly lifting her leg blowing her lips a young
someone 
in the bus shelters canopy and the pretty dog in its Ford 
Talking to you it’s shockingly good
That’s why a box of Amstel in the shaft, analogous epideictic singing
along 
I thought the argument was not in the direction of the field the field
was going toward the management of abundance abundances
emerging clarified the clear present w all that esotericism, well be
careful. 2 men from somewhere vaguely south sit in moms talking
about dumb shit they gotta do. Games. A friend is really excited to
meet the one guy, he’s been asking. Earlier they discussed
Pentecostalism, ordinary dudes. A woman goes to get shawarma from
across the street. What has happened in the bar called moms?
A vaper asked to leave refuses. 
His refusal ignites a series of events. 
All actions ignite a series of events.
All dominoing spiraling out.`}

poverty it doesn’t hold me though
This is how we stayed alive
It had some wood and bottle bits, a painted screen
A picture comes from my head, pretty picture w borders you see
Whatever fantasy that comes to their mind
Old people painting representationally mimetically a big snow-
covered mountain with a cross by an empty glass globe
Instead of decoration you made a painting
The sun going down the colors in the sky they bring tears to your eyes
The people are dying
Fad and tradition`}
