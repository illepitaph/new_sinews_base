      <pre className={styles.poem}>
        {`We were eating fries from Wendy’s
at an Arby’s in New Jersey
when my father’s wife told us
that when her mother was young
her father was beheaded
by the Japanese imperial army

She watched the Japanese cut their heads off
she said

What she saw
went inside her   grew inside her

one of several
voices
in her head

the oldest   the one
who knew everything   saw everything

and kept it
to herself

except when weakness permitted




She had `}
        <i>seen</i>
        {` it
She was not a witness

`}
        <i>that</i>
        {`
enforces
an escalating distance

like looking through a glass box
or a fence

or `}
        <i>down</i>
        {`
at the heads of people

To witness   To have witnessed
would have been
to not have had a head

or to be unfamiliar
with the lament
of carrying the head off

because it rained
and the heads were raining too




She said it like their home was replaced
with the afterimage
of everyone’s arrested face

and the faces of the Japanese men
as they turned

her caretakers and protectors
playmates and storytellers
into ghosts

carrying the lantern
they lit together

shaky, it rustled
grew heavier shadows
on the long, mottled stalks
growing out of her heart

to the flowers that hardened
on the end




She was spared
or escaped

and her baby brother too

took him   and the rice
and ran through mud

they were running in their sleep
through mud   up their ribs

but   like winter
everything was pushed down
through the roots




She saved grains of rice, my father’s wife said

When she dropped a grain in the mud, even a single grain

she stopped
and picked up the grain   every grain

rescued them   saved them
to survive

into another sphere
to retrieve what proved to be missing





The mud fortified the rice, she said
to her daughter   lifetimes later

thick
with hands

heavy
with footprints

people scattering
into the rupture

bearing the soul
of hunger

that would not end
when the bodies fell

still cradling the rice   still ruling the future

that turned each family member
into a torch

or a mailbox






They hid in a cave, she said

The cave was still in her, grew
a shell filled with water
around her

Day became an interpretation of the dream of running
away from their dead

each day   each night
each hour, each step
detached and dispensed   demagnetized

the soul
so the self could keep running

you would think   lighter and lighter
you would think the selves would fall off

but the soul is what absorbed
the sight of the bodies







We listened while eating fries
two, three fries at a time

like the gates were coming down

people advancing up
the greasy floor

kids in a crevice somewhere
salting earth

My father was looking at me
like the atrocity was playing on my face

which made my face real   for a moment

sliding
like a shadow
down the soldiers’








How does a boy find himself
in an occupation force

Does a boy? lose himself
by law

I was old enough to be their older brother
to have gone through the process
of becoming a chest
with drawers,   every drawer empty

gotten dirty and loose

my father might look like those men
if he was my younger brother

the soldiers’ age   and aged with them
into the re-hallucination of Japanese faces









The first time my father’s wife’s mother
saw my father’s mother
she screamed

a black hole in the center of the room
whirled
the winds
of generations around
the space between her and my grandmother

she could see the bodies
more clearly

in the current

and my grandmother’s face
summoned by the gravity of each body

pulled the river
into her

she saw a ghost   not a soldier
the soldier’s mother   staring back

and had to be carried out of the room

Her body became the doorway   it could not hold her 
without disclosing the radiation   it kept hidden

to keep the generations moving

past the countenance of traumas

Devil! she screamed

My grandmother did not understand
she was the terror

she must have seen her elders
in the faces of the young men
strung up like clothes

My grandmother, Japanese, had the luxury
of not being terrorized
by the woman’s ghost

or the ghost of the family members

she could eat and stare, process the role

her murderous present
was holding onto









The young girl became
an entire lightning
distilled

into the strength of an old woman
with eyes on the back of her head

the faces of loved ones   slipping

into the sociopathy
of the twenty-first century

where her daughter brings home a Japanese boyfriend

his face still on his head, smiling

a complete lack of history

holding hands with an overflowing
absence of history










It was justified, my father said
about the atomic bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

both bombs linked
by the dream of living forever
away from being tortured
by reality

The sky fell
a wave
growing inland

harvesting the histories   the division of energy
of many thousands of people 

It was justified, he said
three, four fries at a time

with the attitude of a woman
on her deathbed

resigned, free of nostalgia
many lifetimes of children
carrying on

Was he speaking as an American
a Japanese American
a Japanese American man

one face rotated
to catch the sun in its facets
light reflecting in heterogeneous ways

the psyche running backwards
into the familiar estrangement of a white American
deal
at the crossroads











I stared past my father
at the restroom door
counted the seconds until it opened

Someone going in
Someone coming out

I imagined myself
in the restroom
turning the water on in the sink

Looking in the mirror and seeing
men walking in and out
of the turquoise sky
pink iridescent green stalks of brown smoke

reorganizing deaths
into denominations
of democracy`}
