        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>instantiation</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        And see here, an instantiation as an instant itself, a temporal moment
        captured, attempting to express a template for self, do we see a frame,
        or a fragment, a plot of points that we call a moment, or a point
        itself, the former as a photograph, which we deceive ourselves into
        seeing as an instance instantiated, a frame frozen, for our later
        perusal, to recapture the captured, yet what truly lies within the
        layout is not a single instant instanced, but many, the light though at
        the limits of haste takes time nonetheless to paste itself into place,
        and we have captured a series of moments, close enough for our purposes
        to propose it as one, but the frame is reducible, a single made of many
        moments; is this what we have here, or do we see instead a point with no
        spread, not part of a plot and no other piece to point to, relative to
        nothing else but itself, no parallel before nor after, nothing to tempt
        the gaze toward past nor post, no space for me to move within, packed
        tight between its bounds, I attempt to handle the point as I would
        handle the picture, careful not to smudge its surface or bend its
        borders, but I know it is unbendable, the light has long struck and
        stuck in place, this thing that is both framed and frameless, unbound
        for there is no outer bound to border against; and so I lose my grasp,
        fumble in my fidgeting to hold the moment a moment more, until I realize
        that a point is insubstantial, and like old associations of mind and
        matter the groupings may not group, before we knew what Newton knew, and
        so to impress an expression as my hand passes through I have to express
        my point as a plot, render one unto another for hand to hold and mold
        what can be handled, make finitude from infinity that it might be
        grasped within a finite mind, another grouping ill-grouped but grasped
        nonetheless.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>place</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        Here, we find, is a space warped to encompass all that lies within and
        all else withal, with walls that bend and billow as an inverting bellow
        to reach outside itself, and meeting nothing without what was within
        reaches an end, and that end is supplanted as it breathes a new
        boundary, its walls wrap outward to envelop its own rim again,
        impregnating self with a new self enfolding its skin within; but
        endlessly undulant, each contraction impacted by its own inversion
        reversed and so with inward walls transposal encompassment of outward
        walls once more, and so it has within itself itself again, not another
        space but the same and not another skin but its own reaches outward and
        folds over self; and as it ever expands to enshrine what was beside we
        are left with little room in the imagining for anything other so
        engrossed, for in the beholding I compelled a space expansive, as a
        passage populates the page to perpetuate its places.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>and what fills it</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        And look, here we have one that is a body, a body whose borders
        encompass the ends of its realm, and it seems as though those borders
        are ever shifting and changing, if I should find myself within that
        body, not of the body, as the mind consciously moving that self, but as
        a microscopically scaled model of my own self, this self narrating now,
        if I could find myself coursing through that body, rapidly riding
        through the blood vessels as foamy river’s rapids, mapping the
        monumental network of its insides, my job would never cease, for the
        landscape would shift, perhaps rapidly, as my own body would paddle
        along its paths, and my task would become a fool’s errand, for I should
        quickly see that the paths I partook in pathing were changed as quickly
        as charted; or perhaps the world’s wandering would be at a pace
        imperceptible in the moment, a slow shift that only showed its patterns
        over great expanses of time, time I would surely establish in some
        manner relative to that undoubtedly bounded but seemingly boundless
        body, measured in the movement of the rapids I rode, perhaps, if they
        proved consistent, a constant I could measure over distance traveled,
        time to travel the length of my ship seven times over could be a single
        unit, or if the rapids pulsed, this body as my own driven by a pumping
        heart, the pulsing of the stuff I rode could be my meter, the movement
        of my boat a metronome, seventeen pulses ago I began this narration, and
        by these measures I would discern how quickly the world quaked, and my
        data would become worthwhile points urging me toward better
        understanding that body and its barriers. And I should explore the
        shores endlessly, and ponder the power that moves it, for I had found it
        to be moving at the rate of seven of my own finger lengths per seventeen
        thousand pulses, this number must not mean much for anyone but myself,
        and I cannot quantify it in terms of my own time keeping, how many
        seconds a pulse, or is it days, perhaps years, although I think it
        likely the scale of movement would be only trackable over vast tracts of
        time, something of my own internal experience equating to what I might
        call eons, though time there acted oddly, in my experience, and I could
        only relate it in terms of pulsing, relative to itself alone. And so I
        had plenty of time to ponder that power that moved it, that body, the
        body, really, for there was no other, well my own, but I was simply
        passing through, not a permanent fixture of the world, an outsider,
        outlier, soon to be ousted, longing to be removed, in the meantime I
        pondered that power, was the body conscious, and so moved itself
        willfully, and how did that mind meander, slowly, infinitesimally
        increasing in speed, perhaps, with such subtle shifting, only over eons,
        that is, many many pulses, would it reach the rapidity that I found
        myself charting its course with, but even that is relative, my own speed
        of thought irrelevant, the body experienced its own rate as the same
        rate, no doubt, even as it sped, or perhaps it was aware of its
        progress, I was never privy to its thoughts, I merely coursed its ever
        changing courses, charted its slow and steady movement through the ages.
        I think I was present during its adolescence, for over time I found that
        not only did its boundaries meander, but they grew, I spent many a pulse
        charting the progress of what I believed to be the right foot, and I
        found that the time it took, over many cycles around that foot, from
        heel to big toe to pinky, back and again, thousands of chartings, over
        eons of pulses, that the length of pulsing it took to chart one full
        cycle and back grew exponentially, and perhaps the pulsing was slowing,
        or perhaps the course grew sluggish, and my speed slowed, or my own
        vessel had taken on some extra buildup, undoubtedly this was true,
        though I tried my best to clean its hull, the buildup was unavoidable,
        and not entirely unwelcome, indeed some bits of husk newly hewn I left
        behind to act as ballast, and while possible that I merely traversed
        more slowly or the heart of that body beat more sluggishly I think it
        more likely that the distance was growing, that that body was expanding,
        and it had not slowed by the end of my excursion, by the time I left the
        foot the coursing had grown fivefold, by then I grew bored of the boot
        of the body and moved on, and I never repeated my experiment, charting
        the same part over time, but kept to mapping the movement, and if I went
        over the rest of my data I’m sure I could map the growth overall, but
        the time and energy here are finite, unlike within that body where they
        seemed endless, for myself, at any rate, and so while I have my
        suspicions that that growth still grows I find it less interesting now,
        that I’ve returned, and I have such other worlds to relate.

        That itself only knew its self until my penetration within, but I wonder
        now as I did then how deeply did I penetrate, was I experiencing its
        insides as I experienced my own or was I privy to a place transformed
        and translated as all others experience my own private parts, conforming
        to the contours of a space shaped by palms not my own, its borders yet
        unbroken that we remain so bounded; is this barrier ever erected between
        the bonds that bind, or already bounced beyond with the perception of
        the page, a passage entered that was made as bridge between our
        mountains, so let us clear the way, that we might rebuild upon that base
        of Babel a monument to the masses, that is, to other masses of spongy
        matter.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>regret</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        That upon entering I introduced a violation to its virginal space, as a
        corpse interred disturbs the ground surrounding it, reentrant in repose
        upending its previously salient state, so that instantiation no longer
        is merely an instance of regret, for it progresses toward repentance as
        remorse is wont to do, and further forward lies resent and just beyond
        revilement is slowly approaching too, as a dandelion wilting toward
        disintegration, but not before sending a smaller sense of its self
        toward another, irradiated as a particle expelled passes into that other
        to seed a sorrow deeper than that initial regression, and although I
        left at the earliest opportunity I regretfully believe I set in motion a
        most unfortunate chain of events.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>a moment of realization</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        So that all that existed, all there was to be experienced, rather than a
        world walked within or time’s pacing passage was more akin to an
        impression imposed immediate and complete, as that moment when the
        photon’s pathing is realized only with its meeting an end, alights upon
        a stage as when light finds its way from the page, and then a when might
        begin, and while normally my internal understanding is as a personal
        passage of thought through mind’s myriad troughs alit by a light that
        makes its own time in striking a path through that sky, this
        instantiation necessitated that internally as externally everything
        simply was eternally outside of time, yet like the passage of that
        photon once related time’s passing instantiated, so this passage of my
        passing without wandering within time’s passes can only be expressed as
        a spacetime instance, an instant of time as passage internalized.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>propagation</h3>
        <br />
        <br />I am often unable to tell if the instance I am inside is indeed a
        new experience or one walked many times prior, a near infinite number of
        instances have I both come across and crossed again a near infinite
        number of times, or is near infinite nearly enough for the distinction
        to be negligible, it is understandable that I might conflate separate
        configurations into a single entity, that is that I would find such
        relations indistinguishable from identity, and so although I cannot say
        for sure I am inclined to speculate that I have experienced many
        instances that are distinct only on the minutest infinitesimal level,
        and it was in one of those instances so like our own that I found myself
        walking for the umpteenth or first time unknown, it is all the same to
        me the continuum of chronology to my own life has become muddled, it may
        be I now explore a childhood memory, or perhaps it was some other’s
        pitter-patter, closely corresponding and so adjoined in the
        understanding, I made my way with measured steps not simply measured in
        the sense of pace but in space and pressure and displacement of flesh
        along my sole as I placed my weight down and beneath my feet the
        pressure was returned determined by that ground’s own landscape of
        shape, with its minute variations of valleys and basins if entered
        microscopically like a mountain range made minuscule, and that
        unrepeatable itself never could my foot meet that firm ground in the
        same place with the same displacement of self from a pressure and pace
        and angle arrived at so that every subsequent sensation was
        unprecedented, and while I was ever aware of this nevertheless it is the
        compulsion that I indulged in and so I did take great aims to replicate
        the conditions only on the opposite side, although hardly ever was I
        successful and would inevitably misstep on that second instep, where
        that inner heel met, slightly aslant, and so the matter left unsettled,
        creating another leg so to speak of the pattern extending it, and yet as
        the pattern grows so too grows the likelihood of error, the opportunity
        of a misstep increasing with every foot fallen and so more probable now
        that I would fail, not upset on the instep but by a ball that rolled too
        far asunder, the pressure returned from under undermined the attempted
        reorder, so if successful up until a third left step say and then a
        failure to replicate the precedent pace then the pattern again extended,
        and not by a simple step further, no, but by a subsequent sequence of a
        fourth right seventh overall fourth left eighth overall fifth right
        ninth overall fifth left tenth overall followed still by further
        footfalls of sixes right and left totals twelve superior steps now in my
        pattern, and again only if every one is successful, I may have well
        failed on the final step say of a fourth attempt overall say that fourth
        attempt followed a third with its failure to meet the last step’s match
        and the second attempt to reconcile was simply a boggled second step
        that is second step following the first error fourth step overall, well
        then now the pattern has become thirty-two steps long, yet this says
        nothing of external factors fighting to affect the feel of my falling
        feet, a shift of pressure impressing itself in my way as I pick a path
        through that star drenched place, bright lights glancing upon my retina
        refracting at an angle from the pavement slightly preceding my own
        displacement upon it, or was it concrete beneath my feet, with those
        cracks created by that star’s light radiated slight expansions emerged,
        and so a void beneath my sole then sought to bind me, as tentacles
        might, it sends its patterned parts in all directions, and so my
        replication relied on another pattern star sewn, and what was once
        thirty-two steps long pushes toward an indefinitely many, or maybe more
        depending on the imposition of an order not my own, and if successful my
        inclinations might not yet recede, for it would naturally occur for my
        pattern to recur once more, for in the successful replication a revision
        and so a new pattern to repeat only as if it started and followed
        through on opposite feet, and the potential for the propagation of the
        parts of my pattern would grow more so, for I am apt to mistake my gait,
        and so my dance grows perhaps five- or sixfold, but let us say after
        n-tuple attempts I am finally successful, yet the chronology of my
        crossing this world remains unparalleled, when might I place that first
        foot fallen not merely in reverse but prior, and further the entire
        pattern of these thoughts passing, and so toward who knows what tuple
        attempt we stumble, and at this point I admit the success or failure of
        my attempts at repetition were mostly in my fancy, for the difficulty of
        keeping that many variations of place and pressure and pace in both time
        and space all in line is quite beyond me, so the continuing of the
        pattern or the satisfaction of completion almost turned not on actual
        success or failure but on whether my compulsion grew weary as this
        narration now feels and so ceases to compel although there is much
        ground left untrod.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>exposure</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        And this instantiation can hardly be called such, for while it is a
        thing unto itself, causally closed to other instances and so something
        separate and distinct, it itself is comprised of nothing, and lest one
        imagines a space merely empty yet still consisting of properties
        underlying some order, as dictation regulates our own inhabited inner
        places, as if by fiat, an oration reorganized makes a new world ordered
        wherein one might possibly populate, allow me instead to place within
        mind’s landscape a shape that is not merely empty, not merely illusively
        intangible or ephemeral, incorporeal, whatever matter might mean, as
        Newton never knew, a shape amorphous for informing no border, or if
        outlined where rim erodes for lacking space and implodes those mountains
        amassed outside of sight, and so what seems spreads out unceasing, and
        appears infinite in scope, and perhaps it is, an infinite nothingness,
        and the plane is empty not merely because it has no inhabitants, which
        is true and even if I had ever been within I would have had no place to
        stand, no place to instantiate self and so observe that abounding
        nothingness, thus I tend instead to seeding the right scene within that
        landscape internal, the bedrock beheld behind closed eyes, and so remove
        the barrier blinding us to sights unsought, that all our nothings might
        intermingle, and close with a concern over what is now open, allowing
        who knows what within.

        <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>a worm amorphous</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        Until I arrived to provide a focal point for its budding lines of sight,
        became an obsession of that place that had no place to focus its
        attentions prior, and this intense perception of my self that I sensed
        from outward began collapsing all about me, a boundary newly sounded
        barreling down around me, and that ceaselessly shifting horizon started
        to shape itself to mimic my own outlying bounds, sought to close not
        merely the space between but grew near enough to absorb the sheen of my
        external surface. I sensed this space without contracting becoming
        slowly something like a second skin, a recently woven construction still
        constricting tightly leaving me little room to breathe in, and as our
        outer bounds were brought together the shape moved passed the point of
        simply suffocating as it sought to supplant, to leave the me of
        previously little to abscond with; and as my own limitations would not
        allow myself to exist beside the same, although I yet remained inside,
        it maintained that mirrored measure as well, and so seeing it weaved
        itself as an outer sleeve serving for self’s encasement, a self not yet
        set aside, it made to unsheathe this bounded body it had enrobed so
        well, as a snake sheds its skin behind, and yet I am not the hollowed
        one here but remain bounded within my body, and as I slither away from
        that place that shaped itself I wonder does it match its movements to
        mine, does it slink away as if behind my own tail a mirror shows its
        vacuously shaped trail, an empty shell of my self sliding away into the
        distance. I would not regret in never seeing its empty face staring back
        at me, a peering into my own self finding nothing behind its eyes, just
        the fallow source of sight its transparent lids suggest, as it mimics
        the movement of my face, nothing behind it but the sense to ape the
        shape my own eyes make, or mouth molds as it widens in its horror, or
        limbs take in step with my own as I back away from that place, afraid to
        turn aside my gaze lest it pounce and swallow me again, finding its own
        self wanting it wants to surround a true self again, and so when I turn
        tail and run I cast a glance back and see only its own shape doing the
        same, with frantic flailing of floppy limbs it runs, worried that what
        it had finally disgorged will come back to reclaim the skin it shed,
        become my own surrounding again, or a self transposed, a blank page I
        must fill to propagate my own self never to be a slave to that other
