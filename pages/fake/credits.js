        Cables are hanging down from the ceiling, sparking ever so often. Debris
        and dust cover the shop surfaces and floors. On the wall there is a
        poster of a man grinning ear to ear with his hands strangling a wrap,
        from which a rainbow of foods is exploding. A dark sludge is splattered
        across it, dripping onto the ground. WOMAN OF WONDER and QUIRKY
        NEUROBIOLOGIST are in the middle of this scene, lounging in one of the
        shop&rsquo;s booths.

          Indeed! I feared for a moment we wouldn’t—but now we can finally rest!

        They are eating from two piles of gritty paste. One is light,
        sand-colored. The other is an ominous dark. The sounds they make while
        savoring the food are orgasmic.

        <p className={styles.compactProse}>

          <i>Wow</i>! I never knew hummus could be this chocolate. You’ll have
          to give me your recipe—whenever <i>I</i> get in the kitchen, I always
          manage to <i>burn everything</i>.

        <br />
        <i>Womp womp wommmmp</i>.<br />
        The audience laughs.

        <p className={styles.compactProse}>
          <p className={styles.middleText}>WOMAN OF WONDER</p>
          It is a recipe that has been passed down in my family since the very
          first human being made hummus.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className={styles.middleText}>QUIRKY NEUROBIOLOGIST</p>
          Hey, I thought you were a <i>Themyscirian</i> not a <i>human</i>!

        The audience laughs.

          Oh my, you are so silly.
        </p>
        <br />
        She tries to laugh, but her face doesn’t make that expression easily.
        Instead, she looks like she’s crying.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.compactProse}>
          <p className={styles.middleText}>WOMAN OF WONDER</p>
          I owe you at least a recipe. We were lucky today, that the enemy
          didn’t have the means to fight you and your powers.

          It doesn’t take a <i>neurobiologist</i> to know that they needed food
          to survive.
        </p>
        <br />
        The audience laughs.

          <p className={styles.middleText}>QUIRKY NEUROBIOLOGIST</p>
          Anyhoo, don’t sell yourself short—I’m sure we could have got ‘em with
          just your artillery.

          Yeah?
        </p>
        <br />
        Without saying anything else, WOMAN OF WONDER surges forward to press
        her mouth against the mouth of QUIRKY NEUROBIOLOGIST. For several
        moments, they drily rub their mouths against each other. The audience
        oooohs and aaaaahs. They pull away from each other, completely placid.
        <br />

        <p className={styles.compactProse}>

        The camera pans outside the shop.

          Everything is gray. It takes a moment for the eye to focus on any one
          thing. The first thing is the hollowed-out buildings and the piles of
          rubble around them. Each former apartment, former bedroom, former
          kitchen, former closet, former bathroom, former doctor&#39;s office,
          former ICU, former NICU, former emergency room, former classroom,
          former church, former mosque, former synagogue, former museum, former
          shop, former restaurant, former records room, former studio, former
          storeroom, former shelter is screaming out around whatever remains of
          the building&#39;s bones. The shop the WOMAN OF WONDER and the QUIRKY
          NEUROBIOLOGIST are in is the building which has received the least
          damage.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once the eye has adjusted to this, it next notices that the piles of
          rubble have some moving parts. People. People are shifting through the
          rubble, digging for each other, scrabbling through the rock to find
          whatever may remain of their loved ones. They are filling plastic bags
          with body parts. They are carrying bodies, with no place to put them
          down, to bury them. They are stumbling. They are coughing. Their
          cheeks are caving in. The eye closes, looks elsewhere. This land. This
          land is ruined, no, has been ruined. When the WOMAN OF WONDER and the
          QUIRKY NEUROBIOLOGIST staked out this land in ACT ONE, it was vibrant.
          Now, like everything else, it is gray. The eye shuts. The eye opens.
          The eye shuts. The eye opens.
