        back then waking up your son to walk him downstairs, to the vacant unit,
        to watch the roosters duel was like a family thing you did. you
        demonstrated how to spray cologne for him, tuck his shirt in, shine
        boots, appear impervious to gore. to learn to think that he respects
        above all else a face off. color value vs. color value of a scarf tied
        to your lance or feather plucked by ripples of a lady through 240
        horizontal scan lines. Sally vs. Jessy. 700 Club MTV. young, restless,
        bold or beautiful. or MORTON DOWNEY JR&rsquo;s canine teeth and demon
        tongue extracting marrow from his Habsburg-jawboned freak serpent host
        body MAC TONIGHT. you can only have one of the above cultures. or you
        can have another culture but this one comes preinstalled. the carpet
        desert&rsquo;s double window teaches itself history this way. the mute
        and hungry settlements outside appear to pulse, glimmer, human love
        obscuring helicopter light. inside us still&rsquo;s a syndicate of
        hometowns laid adjacent to the factory premises and work camps to
        reeducate through labor all of this sweet recollection linked by rumored
        tunnel: one smug groove underneath the skin, too hoary, underloved and
        powered down to abdicate. please don&rsquo;t disturb this groove. let it
        fill your abscesses as fog cascades from the machine in all the discos
        of the dead. that&rsquo;s tomorrow and that is it for us

        it isn&rsquo;t clear what type of merchandise this store specializes in:
        there&rsquo;s simply no cohesion to the products offered up for sale.
        austerely displayed are wares like ration buckets, Giorgio perfume,
        fishing rods, massagers, video rewinders, a 2. Casio SK-1 sampling
        keyboard, one of each item set out on acrylic shelves latched to aisle
        walls, as in a catalog showroom. you&rsquo;re eyeballed then ignored by
        the proprietor, CONSTANTIN THE WET, fifty-five, with stripes of hair
        glued by sweat sideways across. CONSTANTIN monitors a many-columned wall
        of televisions stacked three high and here the chatter of satellite and
        cable political news feeds is recorded onto videotapes. he pitches the
        cassettes, which are never labeled, in the shambolic cabin of his Bronco
        at the close of each day.

        funny would it be to upload this <i>free content</i> to Spotify and
