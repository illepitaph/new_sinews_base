        It’s been eight years since an interstellar virus wiped out every living
        cat and dog. A bronze monument honors their memory in a plaza in the
        center of the city. In need of animal companionship, people turned to
        monkeys and apes to be their pets. But the simians, with their relative
        intelligence, soon come to be treated more like servants, and worse,
        slave labor. To make human beings feel safe in this brutally stratified
        system, a militarized state reinforced by torture and mass incarceration
        takes root, as do the seeds of an armed revolution.

        The United States of America is on the brink of war with an alliance
        between China and the Soviet Union. New York City has become the
        country’s supermax prison: murderers, thieves, political dissidents, and
        perverts are walled in; unscrupulous crime lords reign. There are no
        children, there is no daylight. But you can still call a cab. Food gets
        dropped from helicopters and open fires burn in the streets.
        Top-security military information with the power to start or end wars is
        stored on cassette tapes.

        and turning others into screaming, homicidal mutants. A man who is
        immune to the virus spends his days wandering through a ravaged city of
        overgrown weeds and abandoned cars, chatting with store mannequins, and
        encountering the occasional escaped zoo animal. At night when the

        way to transfer large amounts of sensitive data is by downloading the
        information directly into the brains of so-called mnemonic couriers, who
        make room for these gigabytes by removing large chunks of their personal
        memories. Much of the world’s population now suffers from a neurological
        condition known as NAS, or Nerve Attenuation Syndrome. Also known as the
        “Black Shakes,” the disease is caused by overexposure to technology; the
        people who have it seize uncontrollably. Newspapers still exist.
        Mega-corporations rule society, protected by hired Yakuza. But there is
        a resistance movement, too, which joins forces with a data courier to
        thwart Big Pharma executives’ plan to withhold a cure for the plague so
        they might profit from a costly treatment program.

        neural-networked entity manufactures a nuclear war between the US and

        <span className={styles.specialCursiveThree}>2500</span>The polar ice
        caps have melted; the world is nearly entirely submerged except for a
        handful of floating man-made islands built from salvaged materials. To
        adapt to this new world, some have evolved by growing webbed feet and
        gills; dirt is a valuable trade commodity. Still, cigarettes are
        plentiful and a particularly notorious gang of pirates smokes them with
        nihilistic disregard for their health.

        <span className={styles.specialCursiveThree}>4001</span>Humanity has
        entered what some call the era of full employment of memory. Every one
        of us, not only a select few, has photographic memory. Nothing is
        forgotten. This makes us better workers and more efficient at performing
        certain domestic tasks, but over time, we come to realize that these
        cognitive powers come at a cost: We’ve lost the delirious melancholy of
        half-remembering, the only state in which poetry and forgiveness are
        possible.
