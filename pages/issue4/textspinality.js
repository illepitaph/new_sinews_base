       <StandardProse>
       We are bound together by name [not name alone]. The spine is a simultaneously interior and exterior facing
       structure. Its outward face sheathed under a coated cover stock. The interior hidden in the folds of the
       gutter [point-of-entry].
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where your fingers creep. Threading through a matrix of folds [map of construction] and formulating a pure
       sensory topography. Past the point of vision. The landscape is isolated by its haptic components. & with
       this opened hinge, the text is standing on its own.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       “<i>But it could do this already</i>?” The thick text [the tome] is an autonomous entity. It does not require
       external forces to remain upright. This occurs in works such as <span
       className={styles.bluehadowLittle}>2666</span>, <span className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Moby Dick</span>, <span
       className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Canopus in Argos</span>, etc. Where the page count is high & the base of the
       spine is wide.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The tome operates independent of the user-body. Its ability to interface with the reader is only a byproduct
       of its anatomy [biogenetic trauma]. It is not a required process.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We might then say, “<i>the tome is not meant to be read</i>, <i>it is meant to be viewed</i>.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is encountered in the same way one might encounter a building—watching from a distance, admiring the way
       that it has remained upright all this time. Then entering to see that the interior is equally intricate,
       although wholly distinct [ext. tome, int. text-body].
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Going by this logic, the exterior and interior are observed by separate fields of study, and organized by
       different foundational theories.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tome architecture is constricted and unchanging. Variations might occur on the interior level, but the exterior
       is bound to its base anatomy [spine & wings]. Evolution of this medium must then occur through the introduction
       of unorthodox methodologies & new materials.

          <StandardProse>
          <i>Guy Debord observes a scene of new material potential in the sandpaper cover spread of his book</i>, <span
          className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The antagonism of Debord’s construct is direct, grating the facade of its neighboring titles. New editions
          of the text are now hardcover and traditionally bound, but the original <span
          className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span> is a cannibalistic organism. It provokes violence.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Crossing the threshold between object and projection. The mark left by <span
          className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span> is real. It takes place here. And the evidence of its
          actions can be documented / recorded / analyzed.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          “<i>But <span className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span> is not a tome</i>. <i>It is barely 75 pages long</i>.”
          Its uprightness is fragile, and only maintained by rigid plates of the hardcover.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A thin text [the volume] then can be seen as reliant on interfacing [at least in the scope of the traditional
          paperback]. Its relationship to the user-body is parasitic, utilizing its psychic compatibilities / accessibilities
          in order to lull the host—so they might be held & supported [spine grafted to spine].
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The abrasive surface of the sandpaper subverts this. It forms a threshold between the volume and the tome. The
          former desiring the autonomy of the latter. <span className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span> attempts to
          realize this through the volatility of its physique [thorned ext]. It cannot be touched without doing harm. Its
          flesh is too coarse for company.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          “<i>But Debord was not guided by this theoretical framework</i>.” And it shows in his disinterest. The spine
          remains untouched. Only the integumentary has seen change [new paint / new drapes].
          </StandardProse>

          <br/>
          <br/>

            <CenterBlackTitle><span
            className={styles.blueShadowBig}>[what good can come from remaining upright?]</span></CenterBlackTitle>

            <br/>

             <CenterBlackTitle><span
             className={styles.blueShadowBig}>[the spine projects a weak emission]</span></CenterBlackTitle>

             <br/>
             <br/>

             <StandardProse>The subject creates an object in the same likeness as themself. The text [volume & tome]
             is a reflection of its creator. Not in terms of its contents, but in its physical structure. In its spinal
             compatibility, the text lays claim to the same psychic ailments that we have said to be uniquely our own.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             “<i>What binds us</i>?” Debord’s <span className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>Memoires</span> grates against the
             flesh of its companions in the same way your voice grates against my ears [negative transmission]. Its
             spine contains integral structural components, deeper within it contains key informatic pathways.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             We then find the text [volume & tome] mirroring the CNS [central nervous system], articulating neural
             pathways across a closed system. Each object emits a weak radiation—alluding to some form of rudimentary
             nervous system / proto-mind.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Implying that the book is not strictly an object, that it is instead an object approaching subjecthood. But
             what instigates this evolutionary process?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The text must be catalyzed by <span className={styles.blueShadowLittle}>something</span> [word-trigger]. What
             are the origins of the spine? Its rigid alignment? Even knowing this, I am not sure that it is of any
             use. Movement is not necessarily teleological. It can be lateral or multi-directional.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Without the meat to encase it, where do the roots of the CNS go? Do they burrow into the shelf / soil / floorboards.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             “<i>How does the parasite spread</i>?” It spreads because you read it, enticed by the decadence of the
             interior. If the tome is an architectural being, then it is a building made to lure you in. A mall or a
             casino. When you have entered, you become attached. The text travels with you.
             </StandardProse>

             <br/>
             <br/>

               <CenterBlackTitle><span
               className={styles.blueShadowBig}>[it burrows into your head]</span></CenterBlackTitle>

                <br/>

                <StandardProse>
                Held in the air, the CNS exposes its antennae and feels for a pliable surface. It finds the face and
                presses its roots against the readers eyes [enticement].
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                They circumnavigate the socket and coil around the optic nerve, following the route fully into the
                skull. The text siphons memory and power from the user, establishing a parasitic bond.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It stands upright two-fold. Once of itself, and again by proxy of the user-body, which it has now gained
                full functional control over. Articulating the fingers and toes. Then moving to the arms and legs. Feeling
                for the sensation of <i>having a stomach</i> and <i>pacing a heart</i>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The roots tighten and pull the text interior close to the face, laying open page
                over the user-body’s complexion [assimilation].
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The text moans in garbled tongues.
