        Tiff was most ashamed that she was born soft, and that softness was
        construed as weakness, and cultivated as weakness, and for the first
        eighteen years, like a fucking flower, no one saw that she was on a dark
        shelf and simply moved her into the daylight. And she never considered
        seeking light, either—not one time, until she got caught up in shit she
        couldn’t solve on her own. With Grubber John, Bucky, with her
        parents—all of them breaking free of her, and not the other way around.
        Like lizard tails, or like crayfish claws—their bodies floated
        downstream to freedom while she clutched at the detached parts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff went to NA. She went to drug court, rehab. But that crawling,
        itching feeling beneath her skin, deep in her muscles stayed put. Every
        time she saw an asshole, a faker, someone who skidded along the surface
        of the world like beads of hot oil while Tiff sunk, she wanted to pummel
        them, to force them to feel the shame they deserved to feel but somehow
        didn’t. And of all people it was her son Bucky who was skidding now. He
        wasn’t even thirteen yet and was already smoking those expensive asshole
        cigarettes, stealing beer from open garages in the wide daylight and
        denying it to Tiff while it was stank on his breath. “Where’d you get
        the money?” Tiff always asked. “Where’d you get the fucking money?”
        <br />
        <br />
        Whenever Tiff or her parents tried to lay down the law, he bolted—to
        other people’s houses, to empty buildings. The state game land. This
        time, he’d caught a ride with some older guys to a field party, then to
        a trailer outside of town, and then he was gone. There was a police
        report, but they didn’t do jack shit. The cop said, “Wait a few days,
        he’ll probably come back with his tail between his legs.” But Bucky had
        never been that kind of kid.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sky was bruised a yellow-green and Tiff had been asking customers at
        the truck stop outside of town if they’d seen Bucky, showing his
        picture. The semis idled along the side of the exit and entrance,
        clogging the air with diesel, while people in polo shirts with
        out-of-state plates filled up on gas, blinking at the shithole they’d
        found themselves in.
        <br />
        <br />
        From where Tiff was standing she could see the sign for the state line
        on the highway: <i>West Virginia</i>, <i>Wild and Wonderful</i>. Tiff
        kicked at the cigar wrappers, chip bags, roach clips. Gum speckled the
        parking lot, black with soot, like if you made yourself small enough,
        you could fall through one of those black spots and be gone.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Seen him?” she said to a couple getting into an SUV, shoving the
        picture at them. “That’s my kid—he ran away from home.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “He’s <i>your</i> kid?” the woman said, raising her brow, filling the
        tank like she was filling a void. And when the door closed, Tiff said,
        “Racist-ass bitch.” She wiped her hands on her shirt she got at Cheat
        Lake with Bucky two years back: <i>Kiss My Ass</i>,{" "}
        <i>I’m on Vacation</i>. She was a mess and she knew it—mismatched socks
        with one broke flip-flop, jeans that hadn’t been washed in a week
        because she was out of detergent again. Her parents dropped off
        groceries once every two weeks, but half that shit was nasty anyway. On
        weekends when she did have Bucky, they were living on mac and cheese,
        Chef Boyardee, McDonalds.
        <br />
        <br />
        She felt a swell of satisfaction imagining these gas station assholes
        discussing Tiff and Bucky over some hoity-toity dinner, exclaiming, “I
        wonder what she did to cause him to run off?” They would make
        assumptions because they could never understand Tiff’s life.
        <br />
        <br />
        She drove towards Mather where Bucky’d been found last time, in someone
        else’s old barn surrounded by Doritos bags, candy bars, “living like a
        packrat,” the cop said, “off someone else’s dime.” At the police
        station, Bucky had gone to hug Tiff and she’d said, “You think I want to
        hug you after what you put us through?” She regretted that now.
        <br />
        <br />
        Driving out, the vibration of the car on the road soothed Tiff—reminded
        her of being very small, still in her car seat. Trusting that her father
        would deliver them safely, that nothing bad would ever happen to them.
        And for a while, it was true.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s just that the pieces never fit together in Tiff’s life, like
        someone sanded down all the edges, so it was just a bunch of circles,
        jellyfish. After the first bad thing happened, it seems to lead her into
        a world that only got more terrible. Her car was shit; she missed Don.
        No one else in this entire world understood her, or cared. Late at
        night, she’d sometimes walk from her rental down to the creek by where
        the old house was, bought up by a developer, unrented and crusted over
        in soot. She’d throw something into the deep end of the creek that
        belonged to Don: a comic book, a mug. A collectable. Then she’d wait for
        a sign, like maybe the ghost of him would rise up to retrieve it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff had only driven a couple miles on the access road alongside the
        highway before the heat warning came on like it had been doing, and Tiff
        had to double back to the truck stop, popped the hood and dumped water
        into the coolant tank. This piece of shit was always steaming, busting
        open—causing her to have to wait for hours for the radiator to cool
        down. Everything leaked. Everything in this goddamn world was just
        leaking out of itself, onto Tiff.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the truck stop—thick woods. Each tree ended at the sky like the
        tip of a needle. Now that Tiff was sober she felt slower, like she was
        carrying rocks. Everything took more effort. And memories resurfaced of
        things that had been done to her—by Grubber John, by the three men at
        the Motel 6, but why the fuck did she trust them in the first place?
        She’d been desperate. Back then she hadn’t given a fuck.
        <br />
        <br />
        The memory was like a wave knocking her flat, washing her below the
        surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        So those men had done what they’d done. But afterwards, CPS had come to
        the hospital, and among the beeping machines informed Tiff that she was
        under investigation for child neglect.
        <br />
        <br />
        “It couldn’t wait until I was out of the hospital?” Tiff said, blinking
        like a reptile because if the Motel 6 guys couldn’t make her cry, CPS
        wasn’t going to be the ones to crush Tiff. People who felt they had the
        power used it however they so chose, in ways that made them think they
        deserved the power they were given, but it was all bullshit. They were
        just flimsy sock puppet people, running their mouths like everyone else.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff blew her nose into an old baby wipe she’d found in the glove. The
        problem with this world, she decided, was that everything got used up so
        quickly, and then it was just trash. It was gone. But she would not let
        Bucky be gone. Bucky was hers and no one else’s, no matter what CPS
        decided. She made him. She gave birth to him. He came from inside of
        her.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sun was sticky on her back. She trekked to the entrance ramp of the
        highway, then jumped the barrier. Her polished nails reflected what was
        left of the sunlight. Tiff had hitched before; mostly semis picked her
        up. Everyone else was too chicken shit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cars blew by her, truckers slowed and honked and carried on. The blaring
        movements were overwhelming and Tiff felt a wave of nausea—like the
        suctioning end of a syringe.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then a Wal-Mart semi pulled off ahead of her, rattled and sooting and
        honking twice, and she hurried to get in.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Bad place to hitch,” the trucker said as he opened the passenger door
        for her. “You’re lucky. Most guys won’t pick up anymore. Even girls.
        They’re afraid of big hairy boyfriends hiding in the bushes.” His eyes
        were bloodshot. He was blinking a lot. “You don’t have a big hairy
        boyfriend hiding out there, do you?” he said. He laughed, but it was
        forced. Tiff could always tell that shit. The fakery.
        <br />
        <br />
        “I am the hairy boyfriend,” she said, which shut him up for a minute.
        But then he faked another laugh and said, “You ain’t shit, girl.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “That’s probably true,” she finally said, sitting back, pulling out a
        cigarette. “And neither are you.”
        <br />
        <br />
        In the old days Tiff liked to play the game:{" "}
        <i>how far can you get on an empty tank of gas</i>. She liked to play{" "}
        <i>how do you fix this with a paperclip</i>, <i>a rubber band</i>,{" "}
        <i>and a string</i>? She liked to take risks.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the truck emitted its heavy guttural fumes and accelerated, Tiff
        stared out at the woods, scattered with trailers, doublewides, whatever
        would fit a space that no one else wanted. Somewhere out there Bucky was
        running away from his life, just like Tiff had. She wanted to tell him,
        you always end up right where you started. Running is a waste of time.
        And right when you think you’re where you’re supposed to be, everything
        will be taken from you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>*</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Back when Bucky was younger and Tiff still had full custody, they found
        a small pup in a cardboard box outside the Shop Rite, flea-bit and
        tick-infested. “What kind of asshole would leave a dog in the hot sun?”
        Tiff said, cuddling it, picking off the ticks, wiping the eye boogers,
        like she used to do with her parents’ dogs.
        <br />
        <br />
        They bought some water from the vending machine out front. Bucky cupped
        his hands, Tiff poured, and the dog drank. “I love her already,” Bucky
        had squealed, and Tiff felt a pang of irritation.
        <br />
        <br />
        “She needs a bath,” Tiff said, trying to bury her feelings. “If we keep
        her, you’re taking care of her, not me.”
        <br />
        <br />
        At first they kept the pup in the trailer, but by the time it was a year
        old it was pissing everywhere and tearing through the trash, chewing at
        the walls, digging up the carpet like it was dirt. So Tiff drug the wire
        crate outside under an oak tree, but then that dog just barked
        incessantly. “Shut the fuck up!” Tiff would shout. She gave it extra
        food, threw things at it. She’d go out and spray the damn dog with the
        water hose, screaming until her throat hurt. Nothing worked. Then
        finally Some Bitch gave her sound advice—Tiff rolled a half a Benadryl
        in lunch meat—and the dog slept.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the first year Bucky lost interest in that dog, started
        obsessively playing game boy in his room, and Tiff found herself doing
        all the work, tossing dry food directly into the cage some days when she
        could not handle that shit. Opening that cage meant she was going to get
        clobbered. The dog rasped and hacked. The dog overturned its water every
        day. She thought about dropping it off somewhere. But then it was
        winter. So the dog stayed.
        <br />
        <br />
        And then Bucky got off the bus one day and found the dog dead. He began
        screaming and Tiff already knew. She ran to Bucky, feeling like a
        parachute having to propel a heavy body, but she came. Bucky was
        crouched at the dog cage, where the dog’s body was. She was barefoot.
        The snow stung her. Her fingers hurt—the webbing hurt—everything ached.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Oh, baby. She was probably sick,” Tiff said to soothe him. “She
        probably died in her sleep.” But Bucky kept crying. “She was never quite
        right in the head,” Tiff said. “You know that. That’s probably why she
        was left there in the first place.” But he kept wailing, and Tiff
        couldn’t stand his tears, like they were accusing Tiff of something Tiff
        didn’t do. “Stop crying,” she finally snapped, because she could no
        longer hold it in. “You’re acting like a little baby.”
        <br />
        <br />
        While Bucky dumbly watched, Tiff was the one who dumped hot water to
        thaw the dog out, pry her from the wire. The ground was too hard to bury
        her, so Tiff bagged the dog for trash pickup. The weight of that dog, it
        ripped through the first bag, and Tiff shouted “mother fuck!” and
        brought out three more bags, drug that dead dog through the grass to the
        can at the top of the driveway.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Don’t put her in the trash!” Bucky was screaming. “Do not put her in
        the trash!” And Tiff was cold, achy, feverish on and off, back pain
        rippling through her. She wanted to cut and empty these feelings like an
        artery, and Bucky was the only thing there to absorb it. His nose was
        too big, his eyes too small, this molting, reforming creature that was
        once her sweet baby. She could barely recognize him now.
        <br />
        <br />
        The next time he shouted at her, Tiff struck up, “Oh, you are a real
        piece of work, aren’t you,” she said, repeating words her mother used to
        say to her. “You make me do all the work then criticize me for it. It’s{" "}
        <i>neh neh neh neh</i>. You are just like your grandmother, I swear to
        god,” she huffed.
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’m nothing like gran,” he was shouting. “<i>You’re</i> like gran.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff kept on: “Why didn’t you drape a blanket over the top of that cage
        like I’d told you to do? You just sit in that room of yours staring at
        that game boy screen like a bump on a log and meanwhile, your damn dog
        froze to death.”
        <br />
        <br />
        She marched inside and he followed her, crying harder.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff could not stop what was tumbling out of her.
        <br />
        <br />
        He shouted, “I hate you!” And Tiff mocked right back in his little girl
        voice, <i>I hate you</i>. She started washing the dishes that Bucky was
        supposed to wash but never did, tiny floret edges that came from the old
        Canonsburg ceramic mill, dumped when it closed. People, including her
        own grandmother, dug the dishes up from the soil like onions. Her life
        was full of the things that other people left behind: old furniture,
        used dishes—even the newspapers were from her parents, dropped off two
        days later, stained with food. And Bucky.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bucky didn’t know a thing about what Tiff had sacrificed to keep him.
        Bucky took and took and took and what did he ever give back? At least
        when he was little, he’d hugged and cuddled and been sweet to her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff slammed a plate down on the yellow plastic counter. Instead of
        shattering, the plate just spun in circles until Tiff brought her hand
        down on it. “You think you’re so special...” Tiff started up. “Tell me,
        what makes you so special?” She ripped the radio out of the wall and
        threw it, and he dodged and ran down the front steps shoeless into the
        snow, and the minute the door slammed, Tiff felt the surge of rage begin
        to dissipate, retract its shards, but what replaced it was too horrible
        to let herself feel.
        <br />
        <br />
        She got into the bath, let herself go numb, her mind went somewhere
        else. But it kept returning to the year before, when three men at the
        Motel 6 invited her there to party—a date—she used to call it. They
        grabbed at Tiff when her back was turned, when it was all finished and
        she was waiting for the money. And when she fought back she got cut by a
        screwdriver. One held a gun right up to her temple; she could smell it.
        After a while of doing what they told her to do, things she would never
        let a man do willingly, they actually stuffed her <i>into</i> the futon.
        She had thought to herself: I am like toothpaste, I am like ravioli.
        That was where her mind went.
        <br />
        <br />
        They left her beneath that yellow mattress that stunk like old sweat.
        And eventually, Tiff crawled out like she was pulling herself out of a
        sinkhole. Like an alligator from a boiling swamp. Because she was a
        thing that could not be killed.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was in the hospital for six days, and CPS decided that would be a
        good time to try and take Bucky too, because they were god awful
        creatures that tore families apart and laughed about it. Where was CPS
        when Tiff needed real help? Not once did they provide work or food or
        housing or medicine or anything else. They were looking to take Bucky
        from the beginning, because like everyone else, all they ever did was
        take.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Were you at the motel for prostitution?” they kept asking, folder
        perched under their arms. Notepad out and ready to record it all.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Do I look like a prostitute?” Tiff spat back.
        <br />
        <br />
        When she had begged them for help after Don died, these same assholes
        had crossed their arms over the top of their ugly pantsuits and said,
        “Do you think you’re capable of caring for your child?” in a tone that
        indicated to Tiff that this was a trap.
        <br />
        <br />
        That day the dog died, after Bucky ran out, Tiff let the hot water run
        in the bath until it burned her skin, until it was sucked back into the
        overflow hole, back down into the septic tank, which hadn’t been changed
        in years, and leaked right into the field.
        <br />
        <br />
        She wanted to hold Bucky, to never let him go. She wanted to go back in
        time to when he was small and loved her back.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff fell asleep on the cat-piss-stained couch with the front door
        unlocked, and by morning, Bucky was in his bed, curled and shivering and
        tear-tracked, twitching in his sleep. Tiff draped another blanket on top
        of him, turned up the thermostat. Finally, at noon, she woke him. “I
        made some eggs for you,” she said. “You got to get up, baby.”
        <br />
        <br />
        She let him watch his favorite cartoons all day. She took his
        temperature twice, washed his hair in the sink like he was a baby, kept
        saying, “The dog wasn’t your fault, hun. She was sick from the moment we
        found her.” She repeated what Some Bitch had told her once, sitting in
        the Wal-Mart lot, smoking up: “No one gets out of this life alive.”
        <br />
        <br />
        But back then Tiff was defiant. “I will get out of this life alive,” she
        had said back, blowing rings of her own air. “I will be the one.”
        <br />
        <br />
        And then she finally understood that no, she wouldn’t. She was just like
        everybody else.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className={styles.sectionBreak}>*</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff woke late from a dream of Don, stuck in a shed without any windows
        or doors, screaming that he could not breathe, while Tiff clawed at the
        wooden beams to try and free him, knowing, understanding, that one way
        or another, by the time she got to him, he’d be gone.
        <br />
        <br />
        She woke sweated to her bare mattress, shuddering the way she used to
        when she needed a fix.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sky was as grey as the ash off her cigarette. She bummed a ride to
        the truck stop, a jump for her car. Then she spent the morning driving
        around fields looking for any sign of Bucky—smoke, fire, the kids he
        hung with, who swore they didn’t know where he was, because they were
        all lying little shits. In the late afternoon she drove out to the old
        Rockwell Co. mineshaft near the Amwell line where they sometimes hung
        out, through the grown-over dirt road, down a deer trail through the
        woods. Bucky had been caught there before, drunk and giggly like a girl.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff left the engine running at the dirt pull-off—if she turned the car
        off, she’d need a jump again. Then she walked up passed a collapsed mill
        house, maple trees filling the interior. “Buck?” she shouted. “Bucky?”
        <br />
        <br />
        Around here you needed to know where you were to know where you were
        going. The woods were sharp with rattling jaggers, stinging nettle. If
        you weren’t used to it, it was a thing that hurt. Most of the time when
        Tiff used to run away from home she ended up in these woods, curled up
        between logs or inside a cavern created by grape vines snuffing out
        hawthorn trees. Because once you understood it, it was a thing that kept
        you safe.
        <br />
        <br />
        The property was marked No Trespassing, but no one listened to those
        signs. This was Ruby Mine property, abandoned and forgotten. The mine
        entrance had been gated off years ago, but kids had dug like dogs into
        the loose shale nd mud, squeezed underneath the iron gate. They liked to
        drink and smoke inside the mine. Their voices sometimes carried in the
        empty evening air, before the crickets, cicadas, frogs began. Every once
        in a while, the police did drive out there, but then the kids scattered
        deep into the mine—disappearing into the blackness.
        <br />
        <br />
        It wasn’t worth following them in.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today was quiet except for the crows. Tiff navigated between groves of
        multi-floral rose, around what once was a conveyor system to get the
        coal to the river below, and now, on the sunk and collapsing ravine,
        pieces of metal, a strip of belt, hung mid-air, the soil pitch black and
        glittering beneath it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Two years ago, a couple of meth heads got lost here, came out another
        entrance three days later dehydrated and oxygen-starved, half-dead.
        Grubber John, who she’d been working with back then, said that they’d
        probably been looking for copper, and he was usually right about stuff
        like that.
        <br />
        <br />
        At that time, Tiff had thought that Grubber John had been her rock
        bottom. He had gotten her into what she called “dates,” which just
        happened to begin in a motel room, or a car, or a vacant lot, and ended
        in Tiff getting paid.
        <br />
        <br />
        She’d thought it was just once. Then just a couple of times, to get her
        through. But that’s never how a lucrative thing works.
        <br />
        <br />
        And when she tried to quit that lifestyle, to go on real dates, it felt
        artificial, she felt as though she could see right through these
        men—they yammered on about their jobs, their kids, their love of
        fishing, how much they liked Gatorade, all the while Tiff thought to
        herself, “Why the fuck would I listen to this for free?”
        <br />
        <br />
        People thought for some reason other people wanted to know about their
        lives.
        <br />
        <br />
        But nothing was free. These men moaned and panted and wiped sweat from
        their necks, and Tiff was well aware of what they were paying for.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was better not to think about who she was back then.
        <br />
        <br />
        She gave it up for Bucky. Everything she’d ever done right she’d done
        for Bucky.
        <br />
        <br />
        But she still fucked it up, and here she was, trying to find a kid that
        didn’t want to be found.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beneath the grey sky Tiff heard a bobwhite, an oriole call out. Then the
        crows started up with their warnings again. This whole area was
        connected with mineshafts from the long haul days, but you had to be
        careful about the out-gassing. The miners had a ventilation system back
        then. But all of that was long gone, collapsed or barricaded.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff slid beneath the iron bars blocking the entrance into the hillside,
        where the shale was crumbling—all that slag and crumbling rock and soot
        and further in, wet crevices that reminded her of the time spent doing
        work for Grubber John—what felt like a lifetime ago. All kinds of shit
        was left behind: discarded beer cans smashed and piled, and a half a
        shoelace, severed. Rotten railroad ties. She was used to the smell. She
        turned on her cell phone light, which was jack shit against the
        blackness.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Hello? Anyone home?” she sang out. “It’s me, your conscience. You need
        to get the fuck out of here.” She heard nothing but her own voice
        echoing.
        <br />
        <br />
        She followed the main shaft and at the bifurcation, she went right.
        “Bucky!” she shouted. “Buck?” She thought she heard something scraping
        on the walls. Maybe the chime of voices, but then nothing. She followed
        the walls down to the next drift level, still couldn’t see shit. The
        lower level was slick and everything stunk worse. A wood ladder led to
        another level, but it was all rotted out and collapsed. Beer cans,
        shattered bottles. Roof bolters, supports that were rusted and decaying.
        And against one end of the shaft, a black tee shirt that looked fresh.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Buck?” she shouted. She made another right at the fork, heard a hollow
        click, then another. She remembered what Grubber John told her—when you
        hear the tommyknockers, a cave-in’s coming. But that was Irish myth. Her
        own family had been miners—her pap and all of his brothers. They used to
        tell stories about afterdamp. “There’s a reason people don’t live
        underground,” her pap used to say. “Turning the lights on is like
        lighting a fire inside a paper mill.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Now he was dead, and Don was dead and if one more person Tiff loved died
        she was going to go ballistic.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Bucky!” she shouted again, her voice moving through the chambers,
        boomeranging back. She followed the clicking, like after a rain, when
        the water moves through the grass down into the earth. Everything was
        rotting—that sweet stink of old wood and animals and wet metal and shit.
        She stepped over piles of tiny bones.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the chamber opened like a vault into a larger room, Tiff saw two
        bodies, laying in the soot, about a foot from each other near an old oil
        can, pocked-faced and dressed in flannel, jeans, heavy boots. One was
        bleeding from the forehead, the other was shirtless with his arms out.
        Surrounding them, coiled copper, glinting like a burst open star.
        <br />
        <br />
        “God. This is just what I need,” Tiff said out loud. The sound of her
        own voice was important. She was in control here.
        <br />
        <br />
        She reached down and checked for a pulse, like she had done with Don
        when he ODed. She put a hand on their chest to feel them inhale. It was
        probably bad air. The dummies probably didn’t know about outgassing.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Bucky?” she shouted once more, but if he’d had been here he’d have
        tried to pull them out. Tiff felt light-headed, like the oxygen was
        being pulled from her, too.
        <br />
        <br />
        She stepped over a bag of aluminum nitrate, compressed oil canisters
        strewn about, a ladder with metal rungs, going lower, went back out to
        get air.
        <br />
        <br />
        After a few minutes she went back for the men. She drug them one at a
        time by the arms, resting outside to catch her breath. They were both
        skinny but their limpness made it hard to move them. <i>Dead weight</i>,
        she repeated in her head. She was carrying so much dead weight.
        <br />
        <br />
        She wouldn’t be surprised if she pulled something out of a socket, but
        she really didn’t care. They’d be alive and out of the mine, so her job
        there was done. What they chose to do after that was on them.
        <br />
        <br />
        There was no light, but Tiff memorized her path back, was used to
        keeping track from when she was cooking in Grubber John’s mineshaft.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Always know exactly where you are,” he’d taught her. “Memorize that
        shit, imprint it in your mind, because if you know where you are, you
        know how to escape it.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff had a throbbing headache. Getting those fuckers up the short ladder
        was a fucking pain, but she went back once more for the copper. The men
        had stripped a lot of it already, taking apart old machinery, fans and
        transporters and such. And Tiff felt like a pack animal, like a she was
        lugging the weight of every year since Don died—out and into the open.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the entrance, a leftover sign that read “100 days since last
        accident.” But that was a lie. The last blast had taken out 54 workers
        and they’d shut it down. They’d never updated the sign, and the land sat
        there untouched and unwanted.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff left the men at the mine entrance, took their wallets and a
        whopping seventeen dollars in cash. She shoved the copper beneath the
        gate. Used her feet to push it up and out, then drug it like a deer
        carcass down the trail. The birds were shouting. In the woods everything
        darkened early. She loaded the copper into the trunk of her
        still-running car. It took her a long time—that shit was heavy—maybe an
        hour passed. But the copper would pay for most of a new car battery. If
        she went back some day, she might find enough to buy a radiator that
        didn’t leak. She might be able to get somewhere.
        <br />
        <br />
        She’d left the engine running on account of the battery, but now the gas
        was low again. The sunset glinted a deep burning rage. She swerved for a
        rabbit, then for a possum. The darkness swarmed the valleys, this quick
        absence, as the sun emptied out. It was chilling to watch and it pissed
        her off.
        <br />
        <br />
        She wondered if Bucky got scared at night the way he used to, if he
        missed his own bed. When she’d begun running away, all she focused on
        was how to get out. Shit, her parents had tied her to her bed at night
        with a bike chain, and even that had not worked. Tiff busted free of
        every cage they’d ever put her in. But once she was finally free, she
        had no idea what to do with her life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then Don came along, and Bucky came after that. And for a short period
        of time, she thought she was free of the cage. That she was right where
        she was supposed to be. But that was a trap, too.
        <br />
        <br />
        She kept her eyes peeled for lights in odd places—along a creek, in a
        barn loft. The sky took on a color like someone was field dressing a
        campfire, then went deep blue.
        <br />
        <br />
        The gas light came on three miles later, and she rolled the windows
        down, turned off the AC. Coasted when she could.
        <br />
        <br />
        For a second, the air and the deep light, the scent of honeysuckle was
        the exact same as another time many years ago, when Don was still alive
        they were driving to the river to swim, and Tiff knew she was going to
        be someone some day—there was no question. Tiff felt the excitement of a
        life that was still forming—one in which she was with Don and they both
        had the rest of their lives together. The wrongs of their lives would
        right themselves with enough time like an inflatable bed filling with
        air. And then—everything collapsed. Within a few years, Don died, her
        parents got custody of Bucky, and she’d stopped trying to find work,
        because what was the point, after Grubber John got arrested and she got
        probation, after she was told she’d never get full custody of Bucky
        back, what was the point of it all?
        <br />
        <br />
        Caring took too much energy. That was the thing. Most days she woke up
        exhausted, like she’d been running all night, and yet she was right back
        where she started: shit out of luck and jobless and without any path but
        the one she was on. And every time she found something she loved, it was
        taken from her.
        <br />
        <br />
        She had twenty miles to get home, and Tiff coasted hills with the
        four-ways blinking. But even that couldn’t save her.
        <br />
        <br />
        The coolant tank melted out right as she got to the Conoco lot. The heat
        gauge sprung, coolant was leaking green everywhere, and then a few
        minutes later, the engine started smoking. She could feel the car
        emptying itself onto the asphalt, could smell burnt chemicals. And when
        Tiff finally popped the hood, there was a small fire in the center of
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The other people getting gas just stood there gaping. Tiff was always
        the one who did something—the first person in a room with a loud talker
        to tell them to shut the fuck up, the first person to tell a parent
        whipping at their kid that they were about to have bigger problems if
        they didn’t quit. “Stop rubber-necking and call the fire department,”
        she snapped at the fatty standing at his pickup a couple spots over.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff’s body tightened like a slingshot, like a fence line. For the first
        minute she tried to blow the fire out like a birthday cake. It was sheer
        stupidity, she realized, screamed “Mother fuck!” and stormed into the
        Conoco. She grabbed two baking sodas from the foods aisle, stormed back
        to the clunker and dumped it onto the engine, which seemed to
        momentarily snuff the flame to a blue-grey smoke. Then she pulled out
        her purse, grabbed the papers from the glove box, Grubber John’s gun
        she’d never parted with, a knife, some chapstick. She walked into the
        gas station and said, “I need to use your phone.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Oh god,” The attendant gasped, finally seeing everything through the
        glass door, the smoking vehicle by the gas pumps. He pulled out his cell
        phone to call for help. “It’s fine,” Tiff said, but that idiot didn’t
        know fine if it hit him upside the head. “It’s taken care of now.”
        <br />
        <br />
        And when no one—not her parents or Some Bitch or Feather or Ralph or her
        brothers answered Tiff’s call, she threw the phone onto the plastic
        counter and started walking towards the highway, because fuck that car,
        and fuck all the people who never lifted a finger to help her. She was
        wearing the same black tee shirt as the day before, flip flops were so
        worn she might as well have been barefoot.
        <br />
        <br />
        She thought about how she’d make the whole world pay. Once she found
        Bucky, she would get a lawyer and get custody back, or she would take
        him and run for another state. She clutched the purse close to her.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the blaring semi pulled over, she wasn’t thinking about anything
        but getting home.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Where ya headed, young lady?” the driver said like he had better things
        to do, adjusting his ball cap—and Tiff wanted to tell him she was no
        longer young. But then—she felt all of it, every age she’d ever been
        inside of her, tangled like the copper in the trunk now burnt and
        worthless. That was her future.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Snickers?” he offered, and she waved him away. You never got caught
        taking the things you wanted. You lifted them from pockets, stole when
        they were sleeping; that way, you went through life never owing anyone a
        thing. “Have you seen my kid?” she asked, holding out a crumpled
        picture. “He sometimes hitchhikes around here.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Nah,” he said. “I don’t pick up boys.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Tiff glared through him, out the driver’s side window, at the prison
        complex nestled beside the farmland, a bright, beckoning abscess. Her
        head hurt, like someone had sliced from her forehead to her shoulder
        blade. Her purse was heavy on her bare legs.
        <br />
        <br />
        “You got any of that upper shit?” she said to the driver.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Oh, lady, you don’t want what I got. It is too much. I don’t even want
        it.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Give it to me anyway.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I don’t think so. Lay back. You can sleep while I drive,” the trucker
        said. “Take a little cat nap. Hit the snooze button.”
        <br />
        <br />
        She didn’t want to listen to him, but she was so tired.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don used to say the same kind of thing to Tiff, after a long day. She
        felt a chill, imagining it that way—Don at the wheel of the semi, him
        listening while Tiff would berate everything he loved—the music, the
        Steelers, the zebra stripe gum, the dirt caked to the dashboard he never
        cleaned. And Don always just laughed and said, “You’re so prickly. Like
        a porcupine.” He would say: “Stop acting tough. You’re just a big softy
        deep down.” And back then, maybe he was right. She’d say something like,
        “Wrong,” and he’d take her hand, and she’d allow it, and after a few
        minutes of huffing and pretending to be annoyed, she’d kiss his
        fingertips, fall asleep to the vibrations, knowing that wherever they
        were going, they’d get there safely.
        <br />
        <br />
        She felt waves, that stretching feeling of being in two places at once.
        She wondered if Bucky was warm. When she found him she wouldn’t even
        whoop his ass, that little shit she loved more than life itself who
        wanted more than anything, to be free of her. She would hug him and tell
        him it would be okay, that life had a way of working itself out, all of
        those lies people needed to survive.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was jarred awake by the semi’s horn.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Sorry, toots,” the driver said. “This guy thinks he’s James Bond. I
        swear, everyone on the road is either an asshole or asleep. Can you
        believe the nerve of this guy? All these young bucks think they’re stunt
        devils. You know I saw a biker hit a jersey barrier, fly off his bike
        the other day, straight into an oncoming trucker?” He snorted. “There
        was nothing left of him. Meat.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Did you stop?” Tiff said.
        <br />
        <br />
        “Nothing to stop for.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “You stopped for me.”
        <br />
        <br />
        “For the life of me, I don’t know why.”

        He was greasy, wrinkled like someone had suctioned the life right out of

        pressed her cheek against the window, closed her eyes again. Everyone
        was the same. That was the problem. No one surprised Tiff—not with how
        they acted or what they wanted, or what they said. It was so
        predictable. That was the problem. Tiff knew why he stopped, why all
        these men stopped, but to be honest there was nothing left of her,
        either.
