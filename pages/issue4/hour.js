      <pre className={styles.rat}>{`I wrote a poem for the eighth year in a row
Years like trees   black breezes between them

The same poem   knew
what I was doing
I thought

it began in a closet   I put a heavy jacket on
to suggest snow, tomb-like draughts of snow
setting my feet down in my footprints

The poem had a conductor, a host,
a young man, older woman, even older man
who invited me into his studio.

He took the time out
to bemoan what pigeons had done to the place

He had not cleaned up their shit

the place was drowned in a haze   feces and feathers

the haze
of a man who had scratched himself
into apparition.

I saw pigeons whirling
in the dirt of the cloth-like floor,
the translation of greed into maggots:

could wealth be defined as anything carried over
the threshold of night
into day?

The woman explained how I was going to write the poem.
presented it like a test.

If the poem is hot or cold,
is about something hot or cold,
or about being hot or cold,
you are required to make it hot or cold.

In this poem you are shitting
or are covered in shit,
you are required to make and have shit, then,

in your poem,
and so on.

I was given long narrow strips of paper,
cream-colored yellow
mountains   the sky between mountains

yellow mountains
say hello

with your forehead, your temple,
that is where Kannon Lives
in perpetual unwanting

My paper was already torn,   I taped it together,
found a seat at a cluttered work table,

My daughter was the ceiling
the utilities
the rain on the roof
the sky
the planets
water
colors on a firmament
adorned with faint, aspirational stars
the bald rose,

I wrote the eye of the bald rose
The ear of the bald rose

the bald rose opened its eye,
there was no “its”   The bald rose opened,

The paper was a piece of turf
I wrote off the page, onto the table,
dusty with paint
dried clay and dried paint

The paper was a bandage
the self-consciousness of human ruin
flat
on the rim of the gutter

ong   the wound
a serial event

To write a poem while being timed
with seasons of instruction watching over,
under the influence of a four month old daughter`}</pre>
