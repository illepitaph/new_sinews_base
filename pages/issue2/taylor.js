  And from the missing text of memory
  what words float up to hue the surface
  or are hauled by our wreck-divers back—splintered

  mast-like arms, heart keel and anchor,
  salvage wreck and savage savior—
  is anybody’s guess? With eyes that once were pearls

  glow brighter in the unremembered black
  and bend the pitch of what our heart first sanguine saw
  toward a tuning broadcast maritime and undercover

  the keening of the kelp’s slow-motion dance
  the ocean’s prowl and prowess rising
  from our prow’s lilting tough collapse

  sea roses and dawn-licked briny dew.
  We’re left with what imagination has us do.
  Shall I say I saw what happened and can certify

  as sure as witness to a shooting, daylight’s breach,
  who fell, who ran, and who stood idly by,
  while all the centuries wheeled safely out of reach, I

  who am just the most common weedy floating up
  bobbing in danger’s bristling combed white blouse
  a memory of one lost inside a memory

  of salt riffing on the ocean’s schizophrenic tongue
  reconfigured as a journey or a lesson won.
  A memory of one strapped upon a memory,

  bundled round the irritant to form a jewel.
  Those our eyes that once were pearls.
  Desiring disaster to forestall a clean dissolve,

  a myth to dredge up or be dredged up by,
  and yet, and yet, something happened, in spite of all
  a wind, a wave, a tree, a beach, a palm,

  and who came chancing by? A fool, a fool.
  With mast-like arms, eyes that once were pearls;
  head of a coconut; rattling ocean, secret sky.

  Story, strange and powerful, and jittery and true,
  and seeming somehow to be ours, or yours, or mine,
  while feeling quicker stole—lightning from the blue—

        On days I didn’t go
        with her, across the border,
        I sat in a whirlpool, overcast
        and alone, in a square
        of fenced-in concrete

        between the motel parking lot
        and the strip of fast food joints
        that faced the highway
        and mooned their backside vents
        our way. I remember because

        I held a little notebook
        out of the water and was
        writing things down
        from the charred smellcloud
        of fryers and the morning

        dew burning off semi-
        bumpers, trying to make
        a poem. It would be interesting
        now to know what then
        I wrote in the hamburger steam

        while my mother sat in a room
        of waiting strangers under wall-
        mounted 13-inch TVs
        that played (on days I was there)
        college basketball. The water

        was hot and reeked
        of chlorine that can bubble up
        years later. I’m not sure what I am
        more amazed at now
        the blind faith in my mind

        as a receptacle for lightning
        even in the absence
        of significant love
        or that I viewed art as
        a suitable alternative

        to the relationships of life.
        The jets pressed into my back. I
        watched the housekeeper appear
        out of one door, make a transaction
        with her cart, and disappear

        into another. All housekeepers in the world
        speak the same language
        with their bodies, the sense
        there’s no hurry, and no sense
        in slowing down either.

        I watched her go in and out
        the doors, almost better
        than the clock she is tied to.
        More beautiful certainly.
        Closure is not exactly

        the word for it. The truly wealthy
        might own such a clock. Cuckoo,
        the sky opens, and a house-
        keeper changes the bedsheets.
        Probably, her life is better

        on this side of the border.
        A painting like that would never
        hang in a motel
        like this, but it might
        over a tree melting, or in a glass

        gallery in New York. I don’t feel
        any guilt about this now.
        I’ve already gotten to the end
        of this poem. I am walking back now
        with my arms open, spilling the gold

        desert from my sunglasses.
        Having seen not only
        California,
        but the bright maraschino cherry
        at the end of the world.
