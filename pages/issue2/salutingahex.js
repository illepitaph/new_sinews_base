       <StandardProse>
       The scale of any given memorial, the air of the thing, the breadth and the build
       and the torque—should not the whole deal be jigged to the pitch of the absences it
       would re-conjure? Brandon Shimoda’s <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> (2019, City
       Lights Books) knows a thing or clairvoyant two about the functional dysfunctions of
       commemorative monuments. An ancestral memoir fluttering with airy exactitude between
       spells of dream-journal and travelogue, self-appraising photo-compendium and documentary
       testament to the obfuscation of the facts of Japanese-American incarceration during
       the second World War, <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> is also a kind of dirge
       lamenting the broader dirge-scape.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Case in point: the giantly-statured Peace Statue of Nagasaki’s Peace Park comes under
       the memoir’s scrutiny, what with the sculpture’s “mute, immobile, not human” disposition
       seeming more an enshrinement of the atomic bomb than its victims. Ditto for the way
       Shimoda’s scrupulous eye is later aimed at the “unclear” World Trade Center national
       memorial. The contraption of recollection inspired by the most imagination-snagging
       recent disaster to transpire upon U.S. soil sports mechanized water flowing snake- and
       smoke-like across walls and down into holes. Yet despite the hastily-canonized mid-empire
       memorial’s capacity to produce an ever-ready “overabundance of dispassionate eyes,” the
       setting remains “too conceptual to satisfy the patriotism stirred by—and maintained
       since—September 11, 2001.” And meanwhile mere blocks from the twin towers’ former abode
       there stands lower Manhattan’s largely-infrequented African Burial Ground National Monument.
       A memorial to a largely built-over cemetery itself allocated 300-plus-some years ago for
       the often involuntarily-relocated members of the African diaspora inhabiting early New
       York City, the African Burial Ground seems so overwhelmed by the fortifications of the selfsame
       forces of Capital that once upon a time fueled the Atlantic slave trade, “the form of the
       surrounding buildings with their thousands of windows” behind which loom “the people who
       manufacture the blood of their businesses” as to appear “fugitive, because it feels like
       you are being surveilled, tabulated.”
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> accumulatively diffuses, shrine beyond shrine,
       history-corralling-history, the insufficiencies of civic memory congeal and overlap with
       the span and inconspicuous spin of the strata comprising the sun-orbiting earth. The
       terrain of bygone truth is a byway of loss-echeloned voice. So it makes a kind of cosmic
       sense that the narrator duly comes to imagine, with apt geological logic, the uppermost
       aspect of the earth itself serving as a ready medium by which to amplify mortality’s centrality:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <blockquote className={styles.boldQuote}>
       If we marked every death—not even yet a grave—with a mound, the earth would be covered in mounds.
       The mounds would act as impassive prophecy, to which the living grow accustomed, in understanding
       their bodies, their destinies, death, in general, as being part of the evolving topography of earth.
       </blockquote>
       <br/>
       In this way, at least, the history of breath would achieve some less incommensurate equilibrium
       with the history of the planet. The solution at hand is not fanciful so much as lucidly drastic.
       Aggregate, urgent. Aggressively non-transient. The structures necessary for a truer (see: calamity-
       precluding) attunement with the past simply seem beyond current imaginative capacities. Yet if
       the cooly relentless laments for the failures of communal memory in <cite> The Grave on The Wall</cite>—itself
       the first non-poem-predominating book in Brandon Shimoda’s opus—are in no small part the fruit of
       Shimoda’s unusually hyper-un-myopic sense of scale, such scale is a constant in his oeuvre.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p className={styles.standardProseSectionBreak}>{` —  —  —  —  — `}</p>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The space of Shimoda’s 2011 poetry collection <cite> O Bon </cite> (Litmus Press) is a
       calamitously verdant space of “celebration/ incised/ onto terracing air” (“Through the Ghost
       Fires.”) If the overriding structural orientation of our epoch is so operatively brutal
       as to erase memory and make a self-serving staircase of the very earth, <cite> O Bon </cite>
       flutters up and down the smug rungs of the all-pervasive underworld at the incantatory
       expense of the chaos.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The milieu of the poems of <cite> O Bon </cite> is such that “A lady inside/ a translucent
       turnip” and “Beets and radishes chirping” both alike cohabitate with “gummy, embryonic
       skulls/ and bomb shadows” (“Lake M”). Ends of things seem so inextricably tied to beginnings
       as to render the formalities of modern civic memorials intrinsically aloof, almost snobbish.
       “The tastelessness of flesh” rests “upon a ravaged tongue” whereon also sits “the taste/ of
       flesh to an eroding brain” which at once “buds on a ravaged tongue” (“The Inland Sea”). And
       while nuclear weapons and their fallout are persistently referenced yet never quite granted
       definitive procreant credit, the all-but-end-stop-less poems of <cite> O Bon </cite> would
       reverse history’s horrid course and allow the now “darkened shore” onto which our ocean-ancestors
       once upon a time migrated to serve as a stage where “ribbon integuments freshen/ into antiquity”
       (“Crucian Carp”).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the face of all the ritual-amidst-chaos, <cite> O Bon</cite>’s cooly drastic honorific
       correctives seem ideally embodied by one particular character: the former-priest-turned-cannibal-
       narrator of “The Corpse Eater.” Amidst teasingly tactile ruins and strontium-suffused strata,
       The Corpse Eater’s supra-sonic orientation represents indeed the very opposite of capitulation.
       “Plunging the opened body/ eloping/ in fallout/ between tree between tree,” the narrator consummates
       a full-bodied fling with fatality in the middle of valleys whose regenerative expansiveness
       “bruises the raining of ears/ becoming foliage.” The transposed torque of mid-madness life is
       in fact such that “the dead waste dead return.” The tongue waves and flutters, as if the
       instrument of speech is here merely the teeth’s deputy. “I hear you tell/ I want to hear you
       tell,” The Corpse eater nonetheless sings with cumulative sensorial attunement, in response
       to the soil-broaching vivacity of the supposedly posthumous:
       <pre className={styles.quotedPoemLineation}>{`
         beneath flapping roots the will to part
          the ground to say
               I hear you tell
  I want to hear you tell
          mandibles masting
           your throat
          in slats
         `}</pre>
       Bonding the extant with the extinct, The Corpse Eater’s embrace of loss builds new byways
       between speech and the unspeakable. “I flay the form for your return,” The Corpse Eater
       ensures, righteously hastening existential cycles. And the bridge between breath and non-breath
       becomes so mellifluously navigable as to cascade down the page with the capsized sacramentality
       of the flags at the poem’s beginning descending—like a kind of anticipatory corrective of
       the snake-like national memorial water flowing lamentably aloofly through <cite> The Grave on
       The Wall</cite> ’s very framework—into oblivious corpuses of liquid.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p className={styles.standardProseSectionBreak}>{` —  —  —  —  — `}</p>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As intrinsically remote from would-be encapsulating scrutiny as canonical modern memorials
       are from the full-bodied labor of genuine memory—such might be an accurate summation of
       Brandon Shimoda’s post-<cite>O Bon </cite> books of poetry. Each of these collections simply
       cultivates its own unfailingly uncompromising sort of over-archingly elusive ritual space.
       <cite> The Girl Without Arms </cite>(2011, Black Ocean) is a sprawling end-stop-less
       collection of such reverberating sensorial twirl and pace as to render its narrator
       a kind of self-sieving deity, spying the venerable everywhere yet never not shirking
       subsuming fealties. Chaos preponderates, “THE AIR THAT STUNS PREDICTS,” and yet reason
       and vision—and perhaps most essentially, memory—remain salvageable enough to birth
       the desire that “we have to do something/ We have to refuse to suffer an ending.”
       <cite> Portuguese </cite>(2014, Octopus Books) exudes the intimately hyper-sociable
       luminosity of a kind of self-effacing jubilee. “When stuffing slipper into your mouths,”
       one of the many poems titled “For The People” instructs with the kind of casual cosmic
       bent indicative of a more general galactic bearing, “Beware of what makes you extraterrestrial.”
       The words of <cite> Evening Oracle </cite>(2015, Letter Machine Editions) oft-appear to be
       operating at the very frontiers of their inherent materiality. Even fuzziness is immense.
       Accents and registers cooly cohabitate as if ceremonially. “One dreams of living above a
       bathhouse/ In a snow-covered field/ With a procession of white animals/ Passing
       nightly (‘Tsurunoyu’).” Immensities themselves become fuzzy. And the overt-ness of <cite> Evening
       Oracle</cite>‘s polyphony—certainly present in Shimoda’s previous collections, but here bloomed
       into a novelly voluminous stratigraphy—seems to birth a fluidity of utterance all the more
       sonically singular for being operatively suspicious of self-limiting singularity.
       <br/>

       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then in time there is a refrain-like recourse to a landscape of illuminating extremity. At
       once robust and free, rigorous yet airy, <cite> The Desert </cite>(2018, Song Cave) exhibits
       an uncommonly rangey formal fluidity. Continuing in <cite> Evening Oracle</cite>’s spirit
       of nature-mimicking miscellany, <cite> The Desert </cite>treats us not only to poems but
       also journal entries, diffusively-unnamed sectioned-lyrics, email excerpts, and even
       photographical-hints of the kind that later serve <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> so
       vibrantly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Á la Shimoda’s first collection <cite> The Alps </cite>(2008, Flim Forum), the geological
       cadences of <cite> The Desert </cite> are punchily diffuse in a way that seems functionally
       aware of the perils of formal intricacy:
       <pre className={styles.quotedPoemLineation}>{`
         There are the mountains, I see them
         From town, the mountains are magnificent
         Federal Bureau of Investigation, et cetera
         Enormous the mountains are golden and black
         When we go to the mountains, town becomes pathetic
         But we miss it, we want to get back to the lights
         We miss them, the lights being thrown momentarily

         From far away                      (“Mountains”)
         `}</pre>
       As is evident even above, the rarified separateness of <cite> The Desert </cite>
       renders the brutal facts of surveillance and incarceration (and the imperialist
       State’s manipulation of bodies more generally) all the more lucid in relief. “The
       desert,” one journal entry realizes, “is the landscape of coordinated disappearance.”
       Registers (vocal, social, even mineral) are all the while aggregating. Disparate
       timbres click into sonic communality damn near sedimentarily. And if the desert is
       indeed so commodious as to intrinsically hide away its endlessness-tending inventory,
       it’s also true that <cite> The Desert </cite>at hand is a habitat of overriding
       confinement, custody, trauma, abuse, raw hunger, and blindness (willed or involuntary).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As if by historical mandate, the lyric diversity of <cite> The Desert </cite>wires and
       weirds its very silences into something self-escapingly jittery. “Perpetual rejection
       [‘Incarceration’] is comfort.” A keenness bred of restlessness becomes something of an
       ideal in the face of late-empire reality. Yet precisely because <cite> The Desert </cite>
       so assuredly self-niches in an ecologically extreme (see: historically appropriate) setting,
       the book’s radar for breath-beyond-breathing—like The Corpse Eater’s ability to channel
       sentience via the very abyss of mortality—is again fueled by an emphasis on the urgency of
       communal memory:
       <pre className={styles.quotedPoemLineation}>{`
         without ending    migration becomes internal
         for those who do not leave
         keep the memory leaving

         de-located,

         migration was a test. the destination was the extent to which
         a soul could be transformed. The United States wanted to replace
         with a clock,
         the furnace of assimilation. earth harbors
         unintelligible tongues
         in the core,      tongues of flame, they are called,
         the earth answers
         with its cavernous body, I release you
         into the custody of culture      The toll is paid
         by the enslaved,
         exploited, exterminated                          (“Gila River”)
         `}</pre>
       Not coincidentally, the hinge of migration is also one of the main hinges
       on which <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> self-acclimates. Following
       the narrator’s grandfather Midori Shimoda’s immigration to the United States,
       <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite> relates Midori’s vocation as a photographer;
       Midori’s excursion to Utah during World War 2 and the Department of Justice’s
       subsequent tracking of Midori; Midori’s relocation and forced incarceration
       at Fort Missoula, Montana during the War under suspicion of being a spy for
       Japan; and Midori’s postwar move to New York City.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Via just one of <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite>’s uncannily future-haunting
       calibrations of memory, Minoru Yamasaki, Midori’s childhood friend who helped
       facilitate Midori’s move to New York City, also happened to be designer of the
       selfsame World Trade Center whose institutionalized gone-ness the narrative
       ponders not-un-ceremonially. A kind of cooly intransigent geometry of memory
       is thus achieved wherein the past clutters the present ominously. Intricately
       stitching history-caked prognoses with the specter of prospective memory, <cite> The
       Grave on The Wall </cite> corrects the monuments it critiques not merely
       intellectually but sensorially. Bodily. In lieu of memorial mounds that would
       defy the orders of greed which daily erase memory in the way of deifying the very
       defeat of any equilibrium between the earth and humanity, <cite> The Grave on The Wall </cite>
       crawls over and across itself via a kind timeliness-beyond-temporality. Indeed, there
       is even something of an aptly preemptive nostalgia for our shared future embedded in
       <cite> The Grave on The Wall’s </cite> forecast for communal memory:
       <blockquote className={styles.boldQuote}>
       The secret life of memorials is not as much a secret as a subtext: that the memorial
       will not only outlast the people who might remember, who might have experienced, what
       is being memorialized, but people in general: human beings, entirely. That is what
       I see when I see seven mounds or twin holes in the ground (or, for that matter, memorial
       statues, plaques, signposts, inscriptions, etc): a future in which only memorials remain.
       Then the future will be the memorial. To all that came before. The mounds and the holes
       will endure as enigmatic earthworks, expressing, exerting their language, their code,
       for no audience, but for the people-less earth.
       </blockquote>
