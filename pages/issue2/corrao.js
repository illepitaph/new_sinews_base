       The subject of my investigation is not the organism that you thought it was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is an enigmatic structure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       With rhizomatic qualities—like the mutating root of a stemless plant. The
       arrangement of low poly surfaces, each painted with pixelated textures.
       Facsimiles of stone or metal. The internal fibres of a cyborgean contraption.
       Dials and switches locked static.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Light resting in the air, without source or duration. Extensive visibility
       across interior spaces. Even what appears external remains internal. The sky
       a curved ceiling. Haphazardly laid overhead. Painted a light blue with hues
       of white and beige crawling in. Each new room a different iteration of the
       same three colors. Only shifting in dominance and saturation.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Movement through the structure is made difficult through the ubiquity of
       its surfaces. Each wall fluctuating between only three possible designs.
       The researcher—whatever kind of subject you have decided to be—asked to
       memorize the simplistic patterns they form when placed in succession.
       Navigating by foot through chains of corporealized data. What grows in
       the veins of the machinery. Server towers moan in the distance.

      It is not without reason that I suggest this new kind of excavation. Assisted
      by digital tools—a time machine only insofar as a glossary denotes what has passed.
      Where the researcher may examine each iteration of the subject through its duration.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Collaging the archive into its broader width. The entire body of the webpage. In
      its enigmatic youth and its plastic present. Where one becomes several. A multiplicity
      opening its coat to reveal the row of teeth / field of anuses.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This revealing gives potentiality to an archaeology of virtual space(s). Where
      the researcher may navigate these labyrinthine temporalities. Documenting the various
      and ever-changing perspectives of the user. Detailing the mutations in their interface
      and its complexity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The events that have led to its current functionality and aestheticization. What is
      pretty and what is active. The disparity between what is decadent and what is utilitarian.
      Sites that began in primitive fashion. Text transposed onto screen. That have slowly
      mutated into extravagant gestures. Text obscured by its stationary.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I want you to know that this is not a search for the remnants of an organism. It is not
      the archaeology of your predecessors. It is the deciphering of dead and obscured text.
      The locales produced through the mutation of language into construction materials.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Where the text has been made navigable by geographical means. Only to then be neglected—for
      whatever legitimate or illegitimate reasons. It is the desire of the research to find and
      document these dilapidated sites / architectures / interfaces.

         This perspective that you have taken up is incomplete. It is the first-hand
         vision of a half-formed avatar. Limited by the scope of its eyes—the lack
         of peripherals in any direction. When lunging through the boundary you briefly
         lose the ability to see. Your skeptical eye blinks and you are in another dimension.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         And if this is the case, then what good did the intricacies of your movement
         do you? If your techniques are haphazard and sensitive. Your praxis is
         irreplicable. It demands labor and apprenticeship.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The means by which you project yourself are inadequate. This is what I mean
         to say. Your virtual body must be built from more robust materials. It cannot
         be derived from the same linguistic components as the text. You should not
         look like the space that you have chosen to inhabitat. It will reveal your biases.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In the construction of this new virtual form, certain questions must be raised.
         Primarily what differences exist between this avatar and your self. What shortcomings
         this uncovers in your corporeal form. How this new vessel can undermine these shortcomings
         and make you a better researcher than you are now. Than you otherwise could be.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The archaeology of virtual spaces demands a certain nostalgia—as I’m sure most historical
         professions do. In my excavation of the low poly labyrinth I am guided by faint memories
         of its original arrangement. My fondness for these patterns. My current love for how the
         surfaces have remained unchanged since our first encounter.

         in the variety of its branches—game-based, web-based, of the interface,
         internal, etc—but in the multitudes which can potentially spawn from these
         broader entrances.

            <StandardProse>
            Primitive archaeologists have already begun documenting the anomalies
            spawning in the non-space surrounding the virtual structure. With the
            use of simplistic tools—mods and glitch exploits. But their activities
            are touristic. A desire to visit enigmatic landmarks. The documentation
            itself only occurring as a means to monetize this vacation.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But it is a record nonetheless. It is findable. Its shortcomings lie
            elsewhere. In the project of the researcher. The user-tourist is not
            an investigator. They do not study and inspect the artifact / anomaly.
            And because of this, its documentation remains shallow. We are only
             given a record of its aesthetic qualities. Not of its purpose or context.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            (but you think very highly of yourself. and you say that you will not
            do the same. after the construction of the improved virtual body

            but what importance does this have? with the ever-expanding depth of
            this field. of history itself. how do you expect to maintain records
            of each simulated dimension
            <br/>
            <br/>
            do you think so highly of yourself? do you call yourself an archaeologist?
            an archivist? is this only a hobby? your reaching towards meaning

            <br/>

            bring new questions to light. what will contain the history of this
            place? can you bring yourself to trust
            <br/>

            / these virtual spaces. enough at least to hand it all your findings
            and conclusions)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But this non-space is not only a zone of its own anomalies, but an
            opportunity to freely maneuver through the virtual structure it
            surrounds—it is here that we should say that the ‘virtual structure’
            is not specific, but archetypal. In the void, certain qualities become
            visible.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Malfunctions and dilapidations in the walls and floor reveal themselves.
            Each pocket of empty space is denoted by flickering light and texture.
            The back end of surfaces are exposed to the vacuum / atmosphere. The
            sloppy ways in which the invisible is assembled.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Walls that intersect and stretch beyond the connecting floors and ceilings.
            The apparatus as a whole floating in this voidal dimension. Outside of the
            boundaries, the user is not subject to the facades of the developer.
            The aesthetic prominence of the interior is subverted by the ugliness of
            its assembly.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In an archaeology of virtual spaces, the user must move beyond the interior.
            Utilizing non-space to more fully understand what it envelopes / what it is
            hiding. This is not a field of surface studies—although they are contained
            within it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What is then required is a vessel capable of more reliably moving between
            interior and exterior / space and non-space. But there are difficulties in
            this. Similar to those experienced by the corporeal engineer. The builder
            of the space suit.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But here our dilemma is not the shift between atmosphere and the lack thereof,
            it is the jump from facade to reality. In non-space, the fraudulent physics of
            the virtual is enhanced. Viewing the interior as a place of carefully regulated
            conditions, the exterior is a zone of neglect. It is not treated with the same
            polish as its counterpart.

            It is in this body-esque position that we are exposed to the erotic
            qualities of the virtual space. Not only in its relationship to the directly
            pornographic—the millions of videos and images poorly stored on various
            platforms—but in the disparities between the user and their representation.
            This representation, as we have spoken of already, not a direct copy, but
            instead an improvement of its original. So said original may fully utilize
            its mobility in the virtual.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In these differences a certain othering is bound to happen. The user
            bears witness to their lack. The details of their shortcomings are
            subverted by a better body. Which they are then given the power to occupy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The body-esque seduces the subject by subverting the lack that they see
            within themselves. The physicality of the subject loses its fleshy qualities.
            It becomes plastic and unreal. Liken to the fantasies of cinematic and pornographic
            art. The user a participant of this masturbatory simulation.
            <br/>

            The subject of my investigation is not the organism that you thought
            it was. It is an enigmatic structure. With the qualities of an organism.

            <br/>

            Words highlighted as the entrances to other chains—other sets of data.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The user performs a summary of their existence. Creating shorthand variations
            of their identity. Turning one to several. The shift then is from user to arbor.
            These performances becoming the origin point of infinite branches.

            <br/>
            Each made with the intent of invigorating the arbor, but with the outcome of
